We have improved our recipes, gathered feedback, made changes, and sampled our products. We have one concept. We want to Make great beer. Not beer that tastes like a bitter plant, or a leather belt. Not clear beer that has been mass produced and over filtered. Just wonderful, fantastic beer, for the many. All from a very small space. 192 square feet to be exact. We have packed only the essentials into our brewery. We make every batch by hand and we nurture it every step of the way. Great beer is what we work for, and great beer is what we enjoy.","website":"http://www.192brewing.com/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,43],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,15,5],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nFgA09/upload_ACCLxl-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nFgA09/upload_ACCLxl-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nFgA09/upload_ACCLxl-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
