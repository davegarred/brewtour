We were born on February 26, 1971 when our founders took their entrepreneurial spirit and experiences they received making pizza and serving beer at Shakey’s Pizza Parlor to open their own restaurant. That first restaurant was called the Ram Pub, which was a “Deluxe Tavern” that served hot food, including cook-your-own burgers and steaks, along with beer and wine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince 1971, the Ram’s primary commitment has been to always provide our guests with superior quality food and gracious hospitality. Although Big Horn Brewing Company is now one of the largest brewpub companies in the country, the goal of our brewers continues to be to produce the freshest, most “drinkable” beer of the highest quality.","website":"http://www.theram.com/","established":"1971","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,15],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,10,49],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JY4SOB/upload_z3xhX2-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JY4SOB/upload_z3xhX2-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JY4SOB/upload_z3xhX2-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
