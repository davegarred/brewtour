While our farm is remote, we're honored to be on the forefront of the Pacific Northwest hard cider revival and we are committed to producing both traditional and innovative hard ciders using premium, organic ingredients while maintaining an authentically farmcrafted and land-based operation.  We source organic apples from across Washington state and grow our own organic orchard of over 3000 trees, with 20 varieties of heirloom and traditional cider apple varieties.  We aspire to serve the land with cider,  by caring for our soils, watershed and community while crafting award-winning premium ciders. Our ciders are a tribute to old hard cider traditions but also offer an approachable, fresh perspective on the possibilities of the fermented apple.","website":"http://www.finnriver.com/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2015,4,25,18,37,21],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,16,8,2],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/OjrtTM/upload_Yr2UV1-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/OjrtTM/upload_Yr2UV1-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/OjrtTM/upload_Yr2UV1-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
