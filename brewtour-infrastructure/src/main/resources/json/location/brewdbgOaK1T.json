And so Barhop Brewing was born. On brew days, you can hear Tom brewing to the tunes of Pearl Jam, Bob Marley, The Grateful Dead, Led Zepplin, and so on. Tom’s California beer-drinking youth provided him with a strong affinity for the pioneers of micro-brewing, back when Sierra Nevada, Pete’s Wicked, and Mendocino Brewing were small craft brewers. Decades of drinking beer – and specifically micro-brews – have contributed to Tom’s brewing pedigree. (Or so he says.) Currently he is a big fan of Elysian and Russian River Brewing, and these companies have influenced his brewing style which he calls “aggressive California-style ales, with a Northwest twist, using fresh Northwest ingredients”.","website":"http://www.barhopbrewing.com/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,45],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,16,11],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/5efIdI/upload_Vpv6M5-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/5efIdI/upload_Vpv6M5-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/5efIdI/upload_Vpv6M5-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
