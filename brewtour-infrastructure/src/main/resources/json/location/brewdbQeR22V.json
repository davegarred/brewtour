Laht Neppur Brewing Co., located in Waitsburg, WA, offers premium handcrafted ale by the glass or pitcher in our tap room. Sampler trays are highly recommended for first time visitors. We also have Mason Jars, Growlers, and Party Pigs to go.\r\n\r\nAfter home brewing for more than 20 years, Chiefton Brewer Court Ruppenthal, came to the Walla Walla Valley to learn the art of wine making. He quickly realized that what the valley really needed was beer - good beer. After all, winemakers in the valley are often heard saying, \"It takes a lot of beer to make good wine.\" So he decided to open his own brewery, and opened the doors to the public on June 3, 2006.\r\n\r\nAll Laht Neppur beer is produced on site and is available in our tap room. There are no macro-brews here! Families are welcome, and we offer an outdoor seating area.","website":"http://www.lahtneppur.com/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,8,16],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6QNMyS/upload_wAgg4m-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6QNMyS/upload_wAgg4m-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6QNMyS/upload_wAgg4m-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
