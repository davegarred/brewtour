We brew funky Belgian and hoppy NW style ales. Our 10 BBL direct-fire brewhouse allows us to produce just enough beer to satisfy thirsty patrons in our taproom and select local establishments. Our small batch ales often find their way into used wine and spirits barrels for additional aging and second fermentations to produce wild and sour ales!\r\n\r\nWe believe that the craft of brewing beer should be pursued just as you would embark on any great adventure â€“ with an appreciation for history but without the shackles of convention. We approach beer as an artistic medium that offers endless opportunities for creativity, independence and innovation. While we do brew some traditional ales, we refuse to brew just the status quo.\r\n\r\nWhether you are at our brewery in Spokane, a remote campsite in the mountains, or somewhere in between, we hope our beer brings your friends and family together to slow down and enjoy the simple pleasures of life.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to taste the road less traveled.","website":"http://ramblinroadbrewery.com","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2014,9,27,0,7,23],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,59,35],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/YcwZz2/upload_3wHYzC-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/YcwZz2/upload_3wHYzC-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/YcwZz2/upload_3wHYzC-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
