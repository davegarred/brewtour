As a nano-brewery, we make less than one barrel of beer per batch and therefore cannot produce nearly the quantity as other breweries around. It also means that we can afford to brew many different styles of beer in smaller quantities with attention to traditional styles and creative \"experiments\". Instead of having a few flagship beers available at all times, we release two new beers each month. These are only around while they last and then will be supplanted by the next styles in line. You can think about it as brewing only *seasonals* such as a stout or a winter warmer in the winter, a nice malty brown in the fall, or a refreshing kolsch or hefeweizen in the summer. However, the best received ones will get duplicated (but not that often) and quite possibly may become flagship beers down the line.","website":"http://www.nwpeaksbrewery.com/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,4],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,20,35],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eRdXNO/upload_diW6z6-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eRdXNO/upload_diW6z6-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eRdXNO/upload_diW6z6-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
