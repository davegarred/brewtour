On May 5, 1792, the intrepid crew of the HMS Discovery rowed ashore about 5 miles from our brewery.  They brewed a spruce tip beer and enjoyed a day off from their exploration of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Salish Sea.  We are proud to carry on the tradition of brewing beer in this remarkable corner of the world.
