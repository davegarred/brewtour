We have been at this location producing our handcrafted ales since 2005. We take pride in serving our patrons more than just a quick beer or a bite to eat; we want to build friendships that go beyond the bar. Beer to us is something that bonds and brings people together from all walks of life. We specialize in transforming your events and parties either at our brewery or your home into an impressive beer experience. Our dispensing systems are not only innovative and efficient, they will enhance your party and will impress your guests…they will be talking about the amazing beer and the cool “party pig” long after your party. Over the past 5 years we have grown from a small production brewery with a tasting room into a neighborhood hangout. Come in and enjoy one of our handcrafted beverages in our cedar lined pub or out in our beer garden, oh and don’t forget to order our Big “E” Signature Reuben. Next time you are faced with a “Beer Emergency” either personal or with your friends come down to the Big “E” and we will help bail you out.","website":"http://www.bigeales.com/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,53],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,14,45,20],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4VZysG/upload_vyLfTf-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4VZysG/upload_vyLfTf-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4VZysG/upload_vyLfTf-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
