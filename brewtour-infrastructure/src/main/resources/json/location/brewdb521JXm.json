He enjoyed brewing a variety of fresh, flavorful and unique beers and he loved sharing them with friends and family who liked the beer so much they encouraged Kurt to start his own brewery. Kurt had a day job in the insurance business but started to dream of someday opening his own commercial brewery. After years of resisting the temptation, he finally succumbed (with support from his wife, Lori) by buying a building in 2009. Previously owned brewing equipment was acquired in July 2009 in Anaconda, Montana and moved to the Mount Vernon location. Building permits were finally obtained and brewery construction began in October 2009. Federal and state brewery licenses applications were submitted March 1, 2010 and approved by July 2010.  Brewing operations commenced later that month and on August 27, 2010 the first kegs of North Sound Brewing Co. ales were sold to local pubs in Mount Vernon, WA. A week later on September 3, 2010 the tasting room at the brewery was opened and Kurt's dream had become a reality!","website":"http://www.northsoundbrewing.com/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,3],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,20,39]},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
