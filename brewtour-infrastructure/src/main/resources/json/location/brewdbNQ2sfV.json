We believe that knowing what goes in to each pint of beer, and more importantly, what doesnâ€™t, is of the upmost importance. At BLBC we take the craft of brewing beer to the next level by producing as many ingredients in our beers as possible. We farm our own hops, honey, corn, raspberries, blackberries, and other ingredients. We are not certified organic, but we do farm using the same practices without the use of harmful herbicides and pesticides. We strive to perfect every pint of beer from the seed all the way to your pint glass!","website":"http://blacklabelbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2015,4,21,19,30,46],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,16,7,54]},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
