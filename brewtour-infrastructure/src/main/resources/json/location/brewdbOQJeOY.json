In some cases--such as with our IPA, Imperial IPA and Imperial Oatmeal Stout--we push the envelope and make a very big and flavorful brew. Put simply, we brew the beers that we like to drink! \r\n\r\nWe are located in the heart of downtown Bellingham, WA and have been dubbed \"Pure Bellingham\" by the locals!  We continually win awards for our beer, have been named one of the top 25 breweries in the U.S. (by Steve Johnson, America's Best Brews), were declared the Best Brewery in WA (by the Northwest Brewing News Reader's Poll 2005, 2008, 2009 and 2010) and are the only brewery in Washington to bring home the Alpha King award for our Imperial IPA.\r\n\r\nCome have a pint with us.
