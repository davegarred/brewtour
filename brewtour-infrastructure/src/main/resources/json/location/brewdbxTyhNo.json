They were members of the same homebrew club back home (the Mt. Si Brewing Society in Snoqualmie – no rules, no dues, just beer), but hadn’t realized that they shared a dream to “go pro.”\r\n\r\nUpon his return from that conference, John started riffing on a business plan, and eventually turned up the volume to include his wife Cathy, Ryan, and fellow Mt. Si club member Joe.\r\n\r\nAfter a few meetings, we found our resonant frequency as a group: an honest, straightforward approach to beer and to business.\r\n\r\nThe name Hi-Fi Brewing is a reflection of that approach. We maintain a high level of fidelity to our customers, our suppliers, our employees, and our beer.","website":"http://www.hifibrewing.com/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2015,2,26,22,22,51],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,16,5,23],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/187kFc/upload_wyUZxU-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/187kFc/upload_wyUZxU-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/187kFc/upload_wyUZxU-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
