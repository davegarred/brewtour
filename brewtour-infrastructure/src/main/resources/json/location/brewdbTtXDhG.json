A brewery has been in the works for sometime. Lots of discussions on what if we had a brewery were had, over lots of good German beer. The opportunity came for us to travel to Germany to really get involved with the German brewing process and ideology - as well as sample the best beer on earth. After that trip, the direction of the brewery was set. German beer had to be re-discovered by the population. After many discussions on opening a brewery and a trip to Germany, the dream became reality. We found an existing brewery to purchase - Lunar Brewing. After purchasing Lunar and getting approved for all the necessary licensing, Baron is ready to go. On June 14th, the world of Seattle will have the chance to finally taste and purchase Baron Beer. The first style of many to be released is our flagship beer - Munich Lager.That is all for the history. We are growing on a daily basis and plan to be around for quite some time.","website":"http://www.baronbeer.com/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,45],"updateDate":[2016,1,27,18,3,8],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/g5GKTi/upload_3DZ2nS-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/g5GKTi/upload_3DZ2nS-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/g5GKTi/upload_3DZ2nS-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
