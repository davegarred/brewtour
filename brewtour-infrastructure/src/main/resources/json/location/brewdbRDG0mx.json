Erika and Jeff were friends in early college years who found each other later, dated, got married, started a family, then asked each other, “What do you really want to do in life…(when you grow up)?”  They liked beer, liked making beer, liked having a good time, and liked sharing their likes with others.\r\n\r\nTheir first homebrew settings were humble: Jeff’s nose sticking deep into a carboy of fermenting beer in a friend's small apartment.\r\n\r\nThey evolved from the stove top with extract batches, to setting up a small, all-grain batch brewery (8 gallon kettles - Thanksgiving turkey frying pots -  on propane burners with converted coolers for mash tuns) on the back porch,  to bigger and bigger goals.  From a 5 gallon pot on the stove (with a batch of extract syrup), to a 10 gallon converted cooler (with cracked grain), and kegs turned to kettles, to working on a 15 barrel brewery creating batches that go state to state, national, international...  They made batches at home for themselves, their friends, for weddings, parties, etc..  and realized this is what they wanted to do for a job.   Jeff apprenticed with a professional brewer (local celebrity Skip Madsen of Pike, Boundary Bay, American, etc…) and learned the pro angle of the trade.   They have seen the evolution, gone through it, appreciate it, and are happy to be where they are today.\r\n\r\nSalish Sea Brewing Co. is a 10 bbl (310 gallon per batch) establishment.  We hope to brew twice a week, offering a variety of ales and the occasional lager and pilsner. \r\n\r\nJeff and Erika have a  6-year-old little girl and a 2-year-old son.  They are family oriented and hope for the brewery to be family approachable.   Families are welcome, but this is a brewery with a tasting room, not a playground (we do not cater to children).  Please respect our space and the space of others.  Minors must be accompanied by an adult. \r\n\r\nOur roots are solid, our goals are lofty, but our dreams, aspirations, and hopes are high.  We want to create a place to showpiece our beers, invite your friends and families, and for you all to have a great time.\r\n\r\nThe Salish Sea Brewing Company is the real deal!\r\n\r\nWe have three 10bbl fermenters in place, the 10bbl bright tank, kettle, and mash up and running!  Please join us for a beer soon.","website":"http://salishbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2014,9,23,4,28,7],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,59,19],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/s2QjsH/upload_H7IgFv-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/s2QjsH/upload_H7IgFv-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/s2QjsH/upload_H7IgFv-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
