We operated with a menu of fresh, made-to-order hamburgers, fresh cut French Fries and real ice cream shakes. Our 2nd location was here at our Silverdale location. We had fun and we still have Silver City Guests ask us about 39 cent hamburgers and grilled onion burgers. We miss 'em too, but we proved it's real hard to put the big hamburger chains out of business. It isn't as easy as it looks.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 we decided to switch gears and get into the Brewpub business. We sold our Bremerton location and remodeled the Silverdale location into what it is today.\r\n\r\nWe operate today on the same principles as we did when we opened our first Top Notch Burger. We work hard at making sure each Guest leaves happier than when they arrived. We work hard side-by-side with our staff and train them to treat their Guests like you would treat a Guest in your own home.","website":"http://www.silvercitybrewery.com/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,8],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,4,47],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/tIgHYj/upload_A4646V-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/tIgHYj/upload_A4646V-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/tIgHYj/upload_A4646V-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
