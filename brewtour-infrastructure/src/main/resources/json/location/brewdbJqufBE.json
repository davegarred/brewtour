Having spent a few years as a homebrewer and always wanting to work for myself I attended Craft Brewing classes at Chemeketa Community College in Salem, OR and read as many books as I could on brewing. I searched for a long time trying to find a suitable place to open up and could be licensed as a Microbrewery. I finally found the location in 2011 and started the move. Then finally in 2012 went through all the legal red tape of opening Everett’s first Belgian Style brewery.\r\n\r\nDue to current regulations in the City of Everett we are not open for retail sales. You can make an appointment if you would like a tour or make arrangements for a delivery.\r\n\r\nAmong other things we now brew AWARD WINNING BEER! Thats right our recipes are now the recipients of not only numerous Blue & Red Ribbons at the 2012 Evergreen State Fair but our “White & Nerdy” Belgian Wit won Best of Show.","website":"http://www.justicebrewing.com/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2012,10,29,13,24,19],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,38,28],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DdedKX/upload_Ceeh6J-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DdedKX/upload_Ceeh6J-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DdedKX/upload_Ceeh6J-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
