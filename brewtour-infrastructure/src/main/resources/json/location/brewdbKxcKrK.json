Emulating traditional brewing conditions, we brew our beer with local water without amendments, regionally grown hops, and domestic malts. We take advantage of our unique location, on a peninsula between the Pacific Ocean and Grays Harbor, to ferment our beer in polyethylene fermenters at ambient temperatures. This results in smooth, clear, unhurried beer with sparkling clarity, deep, complex flavor profiles, and remarkable consistency between styles.\r\n\r\nWe currently brew 19 styles of beer and are always exploring new recipes to appeal to the craft-wise thirsty palates of the region.\r\n\r\nWe currently brew in a 3-Barrel brewhouse but have plans to expand in the near future.\r\n\r\nOur brewery welcomes visitors Thursday through Monday, noon to 6PM, each week to sample our wide variety of beer, visit with Mark and Robin and enjoy the beauty of Westport and the Washington Coast!","website":"http://www.westportbrewing.com/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,12],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,23,2],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jL4YQE/upload_Pec5qV-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jL4YQE/upload_Pec5qV-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jL4YQE/upload_Pec5qV-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
