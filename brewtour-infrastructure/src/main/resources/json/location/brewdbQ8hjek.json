Brewing in the garage and pondering the idea of creating a place where we can share our beers and passion for creating them. After we took that leap of faith towards brewing as a profession we needed a name. Holding true to our \"Home Brewing\" roots the name Dirty Bucket Brewing Co. was tossed up and the more we thought about it the more we realized there truly was no other name that better describes our passion.\r\n\r\nBy creating smaller batches we are able to maintain an intimate level of craftsmanship and rotate different styles of beers more frequently giving our customers a wider range of beers to choose from","website":"http://www.dirtybucketbrewery.com/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2012,9,8,11,24,40],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,37,2],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JQCCB0/upload_VsQBvI-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JQCCB0/upload_VsQBvI-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JQCCB0/upload_VsQBvI-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
