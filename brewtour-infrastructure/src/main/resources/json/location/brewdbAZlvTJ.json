Ft. pole building at the home of Don Wyatt, owner and brewer, just north of Poulsbo, Washington. Don had five years experience in home-brewing and worked at the Thomas Kemper Brewery before its closing. When Kemper's closed its doors, he decided to follow his passion and strike out on his own.\r\n \r\nDistribution of Hood Canal Beers started in Kitsap County. He later expanded his sales to the Seattle area via Odom Distributing Corporation, and now he personally distributes to bars, pubs, and grocery stores in Kitsap and surrounding counties.\r\n \r\nOur Tasting Room is on Bond Road between Kingston and Poulsbo. It's about the ten minute drive from the Kingston ferry terminal or from Poulsbo.","website":"http://www.hoodcanalbrewery.com/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,58],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,20,32],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Yr1UcD/upload_yzoGTe-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Yr1UcD/upload_yzoGTe-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Yr1UcD/upload_yzoGTe-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
