I came up with a process that allows me to get a rather large amount of body, equivalent to the body of an IPA, but with the finish of a light beer.”\r\n\r\n“We’re bringing beer to the market that ale drinkers will enjoy, because they’re going to be different and flavorful, and we’ll grab some of the mainstream drinkers. Take my son,” Duenwald says. “He’s in his 30s, living in Seattle. He’ll start the night out drinking a Mac & Jack’s or a Mirror Pond. He might even have two of them. But when they’re having one of their all-night fun sessions, they’ll switch to drinking Bud Light. We make a beer that has the flavor but you can drink it all night.”","website":"http://www.goldenhillsbrewing.com/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,56],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,7,57],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yhMoEc/upload_7ikoMV-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yhMoEc/upload_7ikoMV-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yhMoEc/upload_7ikoMV-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
