We believe the old adage, \"You are what you eat\", so we organically raise our vegetables and animals. We use certified organic barley & malt in our beers and we bake our artisan breads with all natural and/or organic flours from Bob's Red Mill.  Our farmstead cheeses are made with raw milk from grass-fed goats at a local dairy. We invite you out to the farm for a pint and views of the beautiful Columbia River Gorge!","website":"http://www.acadianorganics.com/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2012,10,23,12,26,47],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,38,15],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/lgaPWe/upload_s0yBgk-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/lgaPWe/upload_s0yBgk-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/lgaPWe/upload_s0yBgk-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
