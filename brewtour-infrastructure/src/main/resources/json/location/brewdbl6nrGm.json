It is a collaboration of Haley's dream of running her own customer-oriented business and meeting new people every day, Dave's dream of brewing and talking about beer every day, and their shared love of riding bikes. We will strive to be a gathering place for beer lovers and support bicycling as a great way to get around our beautiful city.\r\n\r\nPeddler Brewing Company has a 7-barrel brewing system which means it can pump out up to 14 kegs of beer per batch. We plan to have 8 taps in our tap room with a few regular taps and a couple rotating seasonal taps. We also plan to have a guest tap or two of other WA state brews or ciders. Our indoor space will have a large bar and tables for guests to sit back and enjoy a taster tray or a pint. We will also have a growler and 32oz bottle exchange to take beer home, with a small deposit encouraging the return and re-use of bottles/growlers.\r\n\r\nDecide to ride your bike to our brewery? Perfect! We have an indoor bike rack that holds 9 bicycles and will have a bike work station for you to do some tune-ups, pump up your tire, or easily fix that flat. The bicycle theme will be seen throughout the brewery from the faucet handles in the bathroom to the gears in our concrete counter top.","website":"http://www.peddlerbrewing.com/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2013,2,23,14,44,29],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,41,11],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3OOWRS/upload_iFC7xX-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3OOWRS/upload_iFC7xX-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3OOWRS/upload_iFC7xX-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]},"beerIds":[]}
