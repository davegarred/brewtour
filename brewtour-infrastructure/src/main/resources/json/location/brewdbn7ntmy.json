Now, 80 years later, our love of hops and passion for craft beer has led us to where we are today – in the midst of building a craft brewery surrounded by our family’s hop fields, just minutes from where we were born and raised.\r\n\r\nBale Breaker Brewing Company will focus on handcrafted ales that showcase Yakima Valley hops and will celebrate Yakima’s status as one of the leading hop growing regions in the world. We’re optimistic that we will be pouring pints at our on-site tasting room and distributing kegs and cans to local bars, restaurants, and grocery stores this winter.
