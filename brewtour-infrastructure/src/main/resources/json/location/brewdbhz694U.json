We have a nano-brewery (very small).  We are slowly integrating our beers onto Milepost's tap lines!  It is a gamble if you are going to show up and be able to try one of our brews!  We are certainly going to work on it so we can consistently have something on tap. \r\n\r\nWe also rent kegs and tap handles for your next function.  Please give us a call to reserve your next keg.","website":"http://Milepost111brewingcompany.com","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2014,9,23,4,7,8],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,59,16],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/OlXVGX/upload_tO7Kqd-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/OlXVGX/upload_tO7Kqd-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/OlXVGX/upload_tO7Kqd-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
