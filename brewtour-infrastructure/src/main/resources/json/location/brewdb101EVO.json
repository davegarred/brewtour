Purchasing a half-barrel system, they began brewing a keg of beer at a time out of an ActivSpace unit under the West Seattle Bridge. Beginning in January 2007, they distributed their beer to restaurants and taprooms all over the city of Seattle.\r\n\r\nAs demand for their beers increased, the Schooner EXACT founders expanded into a larger, 10 -barrel system. The brewery moved to the South Park neighborhood in early 2009, and to its current SODO location on 1st Avenue in 2010. After Marcus Connery passed the reins of the brewery over to Heather and Matt to pursue the next chapter in his beer adventures by opening a beer broker/ consulting business, Matt and Heather quit their teaching jobs to pursue their brewery dreams full time.","website":"http://www.schoonerexact.com/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,8],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,8,44],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jYfgIh/upload_EL5Idq-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jYfgIh/upload_EL5Idq-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jYfgIh/upload_EL5Idq-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
