What grew out of that was the opportunity to create  something for others.  We quickly realized that our experiments needed to be captured and recreated due to popular demand.  This created a year long journey to acquire the needed  regulatory approval.  In January of 2013, it all became official and we were able to open to the public.  Our dream has shifted a few times but the desire to create something loved and consumed by many hasn't changed.  It has been a wonderful and stressful journey so far and we can't wait to see where it takes us next.","website":"http://wetheadbrewery.com","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2014,9,23,5,7,23],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,59,27],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hr6RhV/upload_CQgxS6-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hr6RhV/upload_CQgxS6-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hr6RhV/upload_CQgxS6-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
