Our indoor space will have a large bar and tables for guests to sit back and enjoy a taster tray or a pint. We will also have a growler and 32oz bottle exchange to take beer home, with a small deposit encouraging the return and re-use of bottles/growlers.\r\n\r\nDecide to ride your bike to our brewery? Perfect! We have an indoor bike rack that holds 9 bicycles and will have a bike work station for you to do some tune-ups, pump up your tire, or easily fix that flat.

When Reuben and I took Adam to Bob’s (our friendly, neighborhood homebrew supply store) to pick up his kit, I was expecting to pick up a little tin of “beer mix” and a bucket to brew.  We were a bit surprised and overwhelmed by the seriousness of this beer-brewing business.  I thought, “Oh great, there’s more storage space gone once Adam gives up on this little hobby in a month’s time.”  Even though I rarely admit to being wrong now that we’re married, I couldn’t have been farther from the mark thinking that this would be an easily discarded hobby.  The first brewing system has been dwarfed by the upgraded and supersized brewhouse, and there has been no chance for the mash tun, brew kettle, or hot liquor tank to gather any dust!  Adam’s hobby turned into full-blown obsession, and in tribute to the little man who started it all, Reuben’s Brews was born!","website":"http://www.reubensbrews.com","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,7],"updateDate":[2015,12,22,15,27,45],"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n2527g/upload_iInCyj-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n2527g/upload_iInCyj-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n2527g/upload_iInCyj-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}},"S82ANl":{"id":"S82ANl","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1108 NW 52nd Street","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98107","phone":"(206) 457-5524","website":"http://www.stoupbrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday11:00 AM — 11:00 AM\r\nTuesday11:00 AM — 11:00 AM\r\nWednesday11:00 AM — 11:00 AM\r\nThursday11:00 AM — 11:00 AM\r\nFriday11:00 AM — 11:00 AM\r\nSaturday11:00 AM — 11:00 AM\r\nSunday11:00 AM — 11:00 AM","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","breweryId":"q0EsJc","createDate":[2013,7,27,15,4,58],"updateDate":[2014,7,23,19,11,34],"latitude":47.6666529,"longitude":-122.371202,"brewery":{"id":"q0EsJc","name":"Stoup Brewing","description":"Stoup Brewing – The Art and Science of Beer\r\n\r\nAt Stoup, our craftsmanship is a testament to our commitment to the art and the science of beer.
