It’s often a simple dream, a dream to share his knowledge, his expertise with the ones who call him stranger. And certainly the public may reject his ideas, they may cast him back to where he came from. But does this ever worry the outlander? Never. Because the outlander believes in his ideas. He knows what he is offering is great and he knows others, once they put aside their prejudice, will know this too. He knows that someone who has invested their time, their life, their hopes and dreams behind something cannot fail.

Read more about these \"standards\" and dozens of others, including our beloved seasonal ales.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of handcrafting, it's safe to say that no two McMenamins batches are identical.

Beer to us is something that bonds and brings people together from all walks of life. We specialize in transforming your events and parties either at our brewery or your home into an impressive beer experience.

Except, it wasn't a garage in someone's house but rather in Jeremy's business. With concrete floors and roll up doors, it was the perfect place to brew beer—and no spouses would be ticked that their kitchen or home was getting trashed in the process. The reason for wanting to \"home\" brew? Because the Friday beer parties at his business were starting to rack up some serious expenses. After all, we wanted to drink the good stuff and 22oz. bombers ain't cheap. So, Jeremy got the crazy idea (as he often does) to figure out a way to make beer so that we didn't have to spend so much money on other people's beer. \r\n\r\nThe problem was…where to start? Jeremy knew he wanted to brew beer but the reality was that with so many home brewers out there—each with their own opinion on how to do things—it was going to be a challenge to corral and sift through the information he needed to get started and actually brew good beer. \r\n\r\nAfter a few \"test\" batches that yielded sub-standard beer, he got serious and started researching and researching and doing even more research until that first \"golden\" batch came through. Eventually, the challenge went from brewing good beer to brewing good beer consistently. Again, with more research, he figured it out. Then, he got the idea. \"What about other new or rookie home brewers out there? Aren't they facing the same problems I am? Wouldn't they and new home brewers want a convenient location to get it hands-on information about brewing?\" At that moment, Geaux went from a hobby to a serious endeavor to bring professional-level brewing techniques to the home brewing community. Then, the REAL fun began.\r\n\r\nGoing from a \"home\" brewing operation to a commercial brewery (which is required if you plan to brew anywhere outside of home…even if you don't sell it (oops.)) was a bit more than anyone ever envisioned. After a year of plodding away at paperwork, construction, and using up every ounce of goodwill from family and friends, the Geaux brewery and tap room opened up to the public on October 19th, 2013.","website":"http://geauxbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-23T02:31:32","updateDate":"2015-12-22T15:59:10","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DaJPkB/upload_RD3fiJ-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DaJPkB/upload_RD3fiJ-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DaJPkB/upload_RD3fiJ-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:33"},"beerIds":[]},{"id":"cX4OoF","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"21830 284th Ave SE","locality":"Maple Valley","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98038","phone":"(425) 432-0121","website":"www.lumberjackbrewingcompany.com","hoursOfOperation":"Saturday 12:00 - 5:00","isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","breweryId":"IoGFNF","createDate":"2015-10-15T02:29:55","updateDate":"2015-10-15T14:30:07","latitude":47.4066878,"longitude":-121.9617283,"brewery":{"id":"IoGFNF","name":"Lumberjack Brewing Co.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-15T02:29:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22T16:17:18","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IoGFNF/upload_xrWSQr-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IoGFNF/upload_xrWSQr-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IoGFNF/upload_xrWSQr-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:33"},"beerIds":[]},{"id":"jmGoBA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5817 238th St SE","locality":"Woodinville","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98072","phone":"425-483-2337","hoursOfOperation":"Thu: 2:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nFri: 2:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nSat: 1:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSun: 1:00 pm - 7:00 pm","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","breweryId":"4eAHNC","createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23T19:11:34","latitude":47.7817217,"longitude":-122.153799,"brewery":{"id":"4eAHNC","name":"Brickyard Brewing Co.","description":"\"Not Just Another Beer On The Wall\"","website":"http://www.brickyardbrewing.com/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:48","updateDate":"2015-12-22T15:17:25","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4eAHNC/upload_fCKh3X-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4eAHNC/upload_fCKh3X-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4eAHNC/upload_fCKh3X-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:33"},"beerIds":["nWLgYh","29nIrZ","BCcsPG","Pq4Ui8"]},{"id":"2ONHw4","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9130 15th Pl S","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98108","phone":"206-762-3909","website":"http://www.odinbrewing.com/","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","breweryId":"V8LP7a","createDate":"2012-01-03T02:42:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23T19:11:34","latitude":47.5215611,"longitude":-122.3133644,"brewery":{"id":"V8LP7a","name":"Odin Brewing Company","description":"Odin Brewing embraces the exploratory spirit of the ancient Vikings.  We set sail in December 2009, during the height of a global economic storm, and have quickly become one of the fastest growing breweries in Washington, with our beer is now sacking and pillaging cities throughout Washington and British Columbia. We have taken a different tack than many new brewers, and rather than going for a number of very big, single batch beers, we are focused on food-friendly beers in a smaller lineup that is readily available year round. We realized a long time ago that food-friendly by no means needs to be less flavorful, and we actually add ingredients to widen the palate of our beers above and beyond their original styles.\r\n\r\nTo better integrate with a meal and make our beers more ‘sessionable’ in general, we utilize highly attenuating yeasts to dry out our beers to make them less sweet and filling, then replace that desired sweetness with an addition outside the norm, such as Juniper, Ginger or even Angelica. These ingredients are always kept at a level to avoid building a ‘spice beer’, and always present themselves as a unique and complementary addition. We also focus on extremely clean finishes, and use the entire recipe to build bittering rather than just using the hops to reduce lingering starchiness.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the true beauty of any flavor is in the eye (and mouth) of the beholder. Read about our beers here, then taste them at your local restaurant or store and judge for yourself if we have truly crafted ‘Great Beer Designed With Great Food In Mind’.

We hand-fill our Cornelius and 1/6 bbl kegs and hand-bottle/hand-pack each case of 22 ounce bottles.","website":"http://www.ancientlakesbrewing.com/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-12-22T15:13:46","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zRPGmb/upload_XIYGWM-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zRPGmb/upload_XIYGWM-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zRPGmb/upload_XIYGWM-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:33"},"beerIds":["D6Fj9b","YKKcj2","jdQySZ","NmEJ2u","MSPIF3","wRo4KX"]},{"id":"XYs5bX","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"La Conner","region":"Washington","phone":"360-466-1415","website":"http://www.insidelaconner.com/","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","breweryId":"uCyeOp","createDate":"2012-01-03T02:42","updateDate":"2014-07-23T19:11:34","latitude":48.388745,"longitude":-122.497247,"brewery":{"id":"uCyeOp","name":"La Conner Brewing Co","website":"http://www.insidelaconner.com/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03T02:42","updateDate":"2015-12-22T15:22:05"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:33"},"beerIds":[]},{"id":"l6nrGm","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1514 NW Leary Way","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98107","phone":"(360) 362-0002","website":"http://www.peddlerbrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu: 4:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","breweryId":"3OOWRS","createDate":"2013-02-23T14:45:24","updateDate":"2014-07-23T19:11:34","latitude":47.663908,"longitude":-122.377033,"brewery":{"id":"3OOWRS","name":"Peddler Brewing Company","description":"Peddler Brewing Company is a Brewery in Ballard, WA that will be opening its doors in a few weeks! It is a collaboration of Haley's dream of running her own customer-oriented business and meeting new people every day, Dave's dream of brewing and talking about beer every day, and their shared love of riding bikes. We will strive to be a gathering place for beer lovers and support bicycling as a great way to get around our beautiful city.\r\n\r\nPeddler Brewing Company has a 7-barrel brewing system which means it can pump out up to 14 kegs of beer per batch. We plan to have 8 taps in our tap room with a few regular taps and a couple rotating seasonal taps. We also plan to have a guest tap or two of other WA state brews or ciders. Our indoor space will have a large bar and tables for guests to sit back and enjoy a taster tray or a pint. We will also have a growler and 32oz bottle exchange to take beer home, with a small deposit encouraging the return and re-use of bottles/growlers.\r\n\r\nDecide to ride your bike to our brewery? Perfect! We have an indoor bike rack that holds 9 bicycles and will have a bike work station for you to do some tune-ups, pump up your tire, or easily fix that flat. The bicycle theme will be seen throughout the brewery from the faucet handles in the bathroom to the gears in our concrete counter top.","website":"http://www.peddlerbrewing.com/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-23T14:44:29","updateDate":"2015-12-22T15:41:11","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3OOWRS/upload_iFC7xX-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3OOWRS/upload_iFC7xX-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3OOWRS/upload_iFC7xX-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:33"},"beerIds":["z90HN2","ZcSk36","xIjvtf","MpHTDb","uMxjmf"]},{"id":"NXRM7y","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8570 Greenwood Ave. North","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98103","phone":"(206) 428-7709","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","breweryId":"QB5Njg","createDate":"2015-06-08T14:48:19","updateDate":"2015-06-08T14:48:19","latitude":47.6921041,"longitude":-122.3549951,"brewery":{"id":"QB5Njg","name":"Flying Bike Cooperative Brewery","description":"Washington's first cooperative brewery, featuring Member Driven Beer.","website":"http://flyingbike.coop","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-05T22:31:05","updateDate":"2015-12-22T16:09:54","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QB5Njg/upload_vYm3Tw-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QB5Njg/upload_vYm3Tw-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QB5Njg/upload_vYm3Tw-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:33"},"beerIds":[]},{"id":"OcxClb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"342 Carson Creek Rd.","locality":"Carson","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98610","phone":"509.427.4297","website":"http://www.acadianorganics.com/","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","breweryId":"lgaPWe","createDate":"2012-10-23T12:27:54","updateDate":"2015-12-03T19:16:57","latitude":45.7252547,"longitude":-121.8205813,"brewery":{"id":"lgaPWe","name":"Acadian Farms","description":"Nestled in the fertile Carson valley, Acadian Farms is a small family farm and nano-brewery.

Our ciders are a tribute to old hard cider traditions but also offer an approachable, fresh perspective on the possibilities of the fermented apple.","website":"http://www.finnriver.com/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-25T18:37:21","updateDate":"2015-12-22T16:08:02","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/OjrtTM/upload_Yr2UV1-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/OjrtTM/upload_Yr2UV1-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/OjrtTM/upload_Yr2UV1-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:33"},"beerIds":["KLs4DO"]},{"id":"Jt43j7","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Bellevue","region":"Washington","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","breweryId":"4xUGux","createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23T19:11:34","latitude":47.610377,"longitude":-122.2006786,"brewery":{"id":"4xUGux","name":"Decibell Brewing Co","website":"http://www.decibelbrewing.com/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:52","updateDate":"2015-12-22T15:18:26"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:33"},"beerIds":[]},{"id":"o3lsQF","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"509 1/2 Puyallup Ave","locality":"Tacoma","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98421","phone":"(253) 256-5240","website":"http://wingmanbrewers.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Taproom Hours:\r\n2pm-11pm Thursday, Friday, Saturday","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","breweryId":"xIWy3E","createDate":"2013-03-21T19:50:41","updateDate":"2014-07-23T19:11:34","latitude":47.2410896,"longitude":-122.4273045,"brewery":{"id":"xIWy3E","name":"Wingman Brewers","description":"Inspired by Tacoma's legacy of honest hard work, Wingman Brewers strives to create a strong selection of spirited, full-flavored beers for the South Sound region.","website":"http://wingmanbrewers.com","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-21T18:24:20","updateDate":"2015-12-22T15:41:45","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xIWy3E/upload_NU3XOr-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xIWy3E/upload_NU3XOr-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xIWy3E/upload_NU3XOr-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:33"},"beerIds":["TQAHhp","tbjSCD","y5OI3d","KNKiA8","9O28j4","5jt5rG","i3bu0h"]},{"id":"U5gzJb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"19405 144th Ave NE","locality":"Woodinville","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98072","website":"http://www.bluelightningbrew.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun:  11:00am - 6:00pm\nMon:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\nTue:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\nWed:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\nThu:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\n\n","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","breweryId":"oVgASw","createDate":"2015-01-07T23:27:44","updateDate":"2015-01-15T15:54:49","latitude":47.7683859,"longitude":-122.147751,"brewery":{"id":"oVgASw","name":"Blue Lightning Brew","website":"http://www.bluelightningbrew.com/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-07T23:25:23","updateDate":"2015-12-22T16:03:15","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oVgASw/upload_H9ZL4S-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oVgASw/upload_H9ZL4S-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oVgASw/upload_H9ZL4S-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:33"},"beerIds":[]},{"id":"hWi4H5","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1421 Elliott Ave W","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98119","website":"http://blog.holymountainbrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\nWed:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\nThu:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\nFri:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 9:00pm\n\nTaproom hours Mon, Wed & Thur 3-9, Fri 3-10, Sat 12-10, Sun 12-9.

When he wasn’t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick’s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick’s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick’s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, “I started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty”.   And we are all so grateful he was.\r\n\r\nThe brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick’s Beers were flying out the door.\r\nIn 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.\r\n\r\nDick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.\r\n\r\nToday, the Dick’s Brew Crew is led by Dick’s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick’s legacy.  All of us here at Dick’s are proud to continue the dream that our founder started, and we are proud to have you all along for the ride.","website":"http://dicksbeer.com/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:52","updateDate":"2015-12-22T14:44:31","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:33"},"beerIds":["SIypH1","3jruX6","lq8HX0","aLaCSt","3vnQcO","zo4Tui","lK8AEy","mqdIn6","FYBCWS","gFWElp","XCgfE8","c7nI49","sMiIvS","aZcXiq","lAcrbq","yNlzma","NULflH","yuDKS6","dESON1"]},{"id":"hBUDP6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2358 W Hwy 101","locality":"Port Angeles","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98363","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","breweryId":"DoOKNM","createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23T19:11:34","latitude":48.102175,"longitude":-123.500363,"brewery":{"id":"DoOKNM","name":"G'ale Warnings Brewery","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22T15:20:02"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:33"},"beerIds":[]},{"id":"101EVO","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3901 1st Ave S","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98134","phone":"206-432-9734","website":"http://www.schoonerexact.com/","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","breweryId":"jYfgIh","createDate":"2012-01-03T02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23T19:11:34","latitude":47.5685945,"longitude":-122.3342417,"brewery":{"id":"jYfgIh","name":"Schooner Exact Brewing Company","description":"In 2006, homebrewing pals Marcus Connery and Matt & Heather McClung decided to take their hobby to the next level and go pro.

One was an engineer toiling away on the super computers of a local university, and the other was a supervisor managing the complex operations of a local billionaire. Both of them loved their jobs, but more than their jobs they loved beer. Each Don had a recurring dream of a magical place without a name, a place where the great beers of the world flowed like the Salmon le Sac at flood stage, and the fine brewing tradition of the Pacific Northwest stood proudly beside the best concoctions from far-flung breweries in Asia and across Europe.\r\n\r\nDon and Donald worked tirelessly in the wee hours on their home brew mixtures, searching for the best possible combination of hops, malt, barley, and love. For long years, the two Dons had their separate dreams, and never met. A local poet named Bryan had the pleasure of growing up with Donald, and worked for the same local billionaire as Don. After many months of hearing Don speak of his dream of the magical beer haven, Bryan knew it must be the very same place of which Donald had spoken too. He knew instinctively that it was his responsibility to bring the two Dons together. On a fateful summer afternoon at the Elysian Brewery on Capitol Hill, the two Dons met. The event later became known as THE HAPPY HOUR OF DESTINY.\r\n\r\nEvery patron in the pub knew something special was happening that day. The magical place both men dreamed of was one and the same. That very afternoon, the two Dons vowed to create a great beer haven right here on earth, and together they would name this magic place THE NAKED CITY. In THE NAKED CITY, it doesn't matter where you're going or where you've been, all that matters is great living and great beer. In THE NAKED CITY, the only problem is what great craft beer to try next. The two Dons spent a combined 25 years studying the world's great brewing traditions, and couldn't wait to begin experimenting together. Their very first batch of beer, an Oak-aged double IPA, took a ribbon in the Northwest regionals of the 2007 National Homebrew Competition. The rest, as they say, is history.\r\n\r\nTwo years after the two Dons combined their separate dreams, THE NAKED CITY opened its doors. Now Naked City boasts an award-winning brewery that produces a variety of small-batch beers available at the pub and friendly bars and restaurants in Seattle, Tacoma, Bellingham, and beyond. The 24 taps of THE NAKED CITY offer a constantly rotating variety of Washington's best beers, regional craft beers, and the best beers Donald and Don have found in two lifetimes of beer travels around the world.\r\n\r\nTwo and a half years after THE NAKED CITY was founded, the Dons convinced the local poet who brought them together to join them in the adventure. The Dons and Bryan together built a bigger brewery; a full-size kitchen; a dining room/movie theatre called The Screening Room that features free monthly events including film, comedy, poetry, community discusssion, and jazz; and now The Walrus Beer Garden, a patio that's home to murals by local artists, games, and summertime events.\r\n\r\nSo.

The opportunity came for us to travel to Germany to really get involved with the German brewing process and ideology - as well as sample the best beer on earth. After that trip, the direction of the brewery was set. German beer had to be re-discovered by the population. After many discussions on opening a brewery and a trip to Germany, the dream became reality. We found an existing brewery to purchase - Lunar Brewing. After purchasing Lunar and getting approved for all the necessary licensing, Baron is ready to go. On June 14th, the world of Seattle will have the chance to finally taste and purchase Baron Beer. The first style of many to be released is our flagship beer - Munich Lager.That is all for the history.

It had a very mom and pop feel, and featured a look that was as traditional as it gets. Those who knew of it visited regularly, but the regulars were few. For many, the brewery was a thing shrouded in mystery... college students-which comprise a fair percentage of Ellensburg's population for most of the year-would occasionally see a bottle on a store shelf and ask where it came from. The likely response:\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I think some dude makes that in his basement or something...\"\r\n\r\nThe word just wasn't getting out, and things didn't look good for the tiny brewery that made exceptionally tasty ales. \r\nWell, a couple of hoodlums in their late-twenties jumped on the opportunity to own and operate their own brewery, and what resulted is the Iron Horse Brewery you know and love today. They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen. Locals started to dig what the guys were doing. A few bars took a chance and put Iron Horse back on tap, and the beer started flowing. \r\n\r\nThe word started getting out.","website":"http://www.ironhorsebrewery.com/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22T15:04:41","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ni4EnY/upload_V7RJjR-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ni4EnY/upload_V7RJjR-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ni4EnY/upload_V7RJjR-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:33"},"beerIds":["hnAczC","zVgmBl","PhVTto","YkL3RV","UzUHiN","sflTYw","B43raw","K6tR8d","T9j0gK","5TRopl","EWHONS","nNmfkN","qq0CWt"]},{"id":"VipzfD","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"716 Pacific Ave","locality":"Tacoma","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98402","phone":"253-327-1680","website":"www.oddotterbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon: 2:00pm - 2:00am\r\nTues: 2:00pm - 2:00am\r\nWed: 2:00pm - 2:00am\r\nThu:  2:00pm - 2:00am\r\nFri:  2:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSun:  11:00am - 2:00am","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","breweryId":"ibk8A0","createDate":"2015-01-20T19:43:35","updateDate":"2015-06-23T12:47:59","latitude":47.2566977,"longitude":-122.4395469,"brewery":{"id":"ibk8A0","name":"Odd Otter Brewing Company","description":"Odd Otter Brewing Company is a new, exciting nanobrewery in downtown Tacoma, WA.","website":"http://www.oddotterbrewing.com/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-13T17:31:33","updateDate":"2015-12-22T16:02:12","images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ibk8A0/upload_JNOryH-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ibk8A0/upload_JNOryH-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ibk8A0/upload_JNOryH-large.png"}},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03T02:41:33"},"beerIds":["dUPsdo","QAnH8n","85883P"]},{"id":"5GKTi0","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5612 NE 119th St.","locality":"Vancouver","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98686","phone":"(360) 601-7454","website":"http://www.heathenbrewing.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu - Fri: 4:00 pm - 7:00 pm\r\nSat: 1:00 pm - 7:00 pm","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","breweryId":"5SFznI","createDate":"2013-07-30T16:09:23","updateDate":"2014-07-23T19:11:34","latitude":45.708808,"longitude":-122.613613,"brewery":{"id":"5SFznI","name":"Heathen Brewing","description":"Heathen Brewing is a small craft brewery that was created from the soul of home brewing.

They first met during graduate school at the University of Minnesota where the fates would have it, they joined the same chemistry research group.  The guys spent many a night proving the adage of their PhD (piled higher & deeper) advisor, “The true test of running a scientific instrument is being able to operate it after a few beers.”  After graduation, Grant and Phil pursued different career paths, Grant went the academic route, while Phil initially started out in the chemical industry, but then wised up and conned people into hiring him as a beer then wine chemist.  After a few years of chasing the academic and corporate dollar, the boys wised up and decided to strike out on their own.  They landed in Vancouver, WA (which was the first Vancouver, by the way) and started up Dirty Hands Brewing Company.  From the start, their goal was to brew full flavored beers that were both balanced and highly drinkable.

The idea of opening a brewery came to us in the spring of 2007, when we were both working as cooks in Spokane. At the time we were 18 and 21 years old. One spring day, we made the decision to quit our jobs and start a brewery. Shortly after that, we bought our first homebrew kit and brewed our first few batches. We knew that this is what we wanted to do with our lives. Our family encouraged us and helped us gather enough equipment to open our brewery. We became licensed to sell beer in Washington in January of 2010. We opened our new location and taproom at 2018 E Riverside Ave, Suite #1 in Spokane in May of 2011. We take pride in brewing quality beers made with the freshest ingredients around. All of our brews also contain a special touch of “Budge Bros Magic”. We have many exciting plans for the future, including an exclusive “Plastic Cup Club”, special events at the Taproom, seasonal brews, and cool new merchandise. We also serve the best Popcorn in the Greater Spokane Area.\r\n\r\nWhile you’re here, feel free to poke around and check out the types of beer we brew.

Erika and Jeff were friends in early college years who found each other later, dated, got married, started a family, then asked each other, “What do you really want to do in life…(when you grow up)?”  They liked beer, liked making beer, liked having a good time, and liked sharing their likes with others.\r\n\r\nTheir first homebrew settings were humble: Jeff’s nose sticking deep into a carboy of fermenting beer in a friend's small apartment.\r\n\r\nThey evolved from the stove top with extract batches, to setting up a small, all-grain batch brewery (8 gallon kettles - Thanksgiving turkey frying pots -  on propane burners with converted coolers for mash tuns) on the back porch,  to bigger and bigger goals.  From a 5 gallon pot on the stove (with a batch of extract syrup), to a 10 gallon converted cooler (with cracked grain), and kegs turned to kettles, to working on a 15 barrel brewery creating batches that go state to state, national, international...  They made batches at home for themselves, their friends, for weddings, parties, etc..  and realized this is what they wanted to do for a job.   Jeff apprenticed with a professional brewer (local celebrity Skip Madsen of Pike, Boundary Bay, American, etc…) and learned the pro angle of the trade.   They have seen the evolution, gone through it, appreciate it, and are happy to be where they are today.\r\n\r\nSalish Sea Brewing Co. is a 10 bbl (310 gallon per batch) establishment.  We hope to brew twice a week, offering a variety of ales and the occasional lager and pilsner. \r\n\r\nJeff and Erika have a  6-year-old little girl and a 2-year-old son.  They are family oriented and hope for the brewery to be family approachable.   Families are welcome, but this is a brewery with a tasting room, not a playground (we do not cater to children).  Please respect our space and the space of others.  Minors must be accompanied by an adult. \r\n\r\nOur roots are solid, our goals are lofty, but our dreams, aspirations, and hopes are high.

He enjoyed brewing a variety of fresh, flavorful and unique beers and he loved sharing them with friends and family who liked the beer so much they encouraged Kurt to start his own brewery. Kurt had a day job in the insurance business but started to dream of someday opening his own commercial brewery. After years of resisting the temptation, he finally succumbed (with support from his wife, Lori) by buying a building in 2009. Previously owned brewing equipment was acquired in July 2009 in Anaconda, Montana and moved to the Mount Vernon location. Building permits were finally obtained and brewery construction began in October 2009. Federal and state brewery licenses applications were submitted March 1, 2010 and approved by July 2010.  Brewing operations commenced later that month and on August 27, 2010 the first kegs of North Sound Brewing Co. ales were sold to local pubs in Mount Vernon, WA.

Instead of having a few flagship beers available at all times, we release two new beers each month. These are only around while they last and then will be supplanted by the next styles in line. You can think about it as brewing only *seasonals* such as a stout or a winter warmer in the winter, a nice malty brown in the fall, or a refreshing kolsch or hefeweizen in the summer.
