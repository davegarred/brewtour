Our first Seattle location, a 220-seat beer hall and our main brewery, opened in 1996 on Capitol Hill, Seattle’s most populous neighborhood. In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks—a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery/bistro. With a 3-bbl pilot brewery, Elysian-TangleTown acted as the brewers' test kitchen, fueling the creative fires and helping cement Elysian's reputation as Seattle’s top brewpub. The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle’s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays. It is typical for us to offer over twenty different Elysian beers between the three locations.","latitude":47.614033,"longitude":-122.315716,"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hvWfx5/upload_3WbnsW-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hvWfx5/upload_3WbnsW-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hvWfx5/upload_3WbnsW-large.png"},"beerIds":["yDmuOk","X5IBlf","CrEWhc","ObF1bC","9P0zv6","pAxKr3","qJXaAl","RJwRxf","8y2zhD","2VUwUG","XCBamo","lHlnqe","SdyQbx","RUg90U","sHuROM","aXViYB","NbUc05","8izDs0","sSe8RB","ORwgoV","hpYH48","3oOx9v","zvDQ9W","cEwEIx","UbdFXn","EYf2SO","9UT2g7","lEt5KO","EOrdEN","9VuOwF","IRqZSn","KZVlT5","5BJeKT","kjO2Tg","cANtzW","qsNqbp","PUpM9X","zhMl3O","gXrN7Y","c58p4w","JzE8lt","FfpDCa","CHB9XT","QoeMxO","7GcTwR","ulZNcE","Lu46FJ","jaLI5s","g87lJM"]},{"id":"bQ8Tb6","breweryId":"b6oU3L","breweryName":"Urban Family Brewing","breweryDescription":"We are a family-run brewery located in the heart of Ballard, Seattle.","latitude":47.6605583,"longitude":-122.3899516,"images":null,"beerIds":["inrKP7","7Ii1QU","jcQpZv","6U8WFg","Lw9djM","CtK4Bf"]},{"id":"R59V2j","breweryId":"WF34ng","breweryName":"Naked City Brewery & Taphouse","breweryDescription":"Once upon a time, there were two dudes named Donald and Don. One was an engineer toiling away on the super computers of a local university, and the other was a supervisor managing the complex operations of a local billionaire. Both of them loved their jobs, but more than their jobs they loved beer. Each Don had a recurring dream of a magical place without a name, a place where the great beers of the world flowed like the Salmon le Sac at flood stage, and the fine brewing tradition of the Pacific Northwest stood proudly beside the best concoctions from far-flung breweries in Asia and across Europe.\r\n\r\nDon and Donald worked tirelessly in the wee hours on their home brew mixtures, searching for the best possible combination of hops, malt, barley, and love. For long years, the two Dons had their separate dreams, and never met. A local poet named Bryan had the pleasure of growing up with Donald, and worked for the same local billionaire as Don. After many months of hearing Don speak of his dream of the magical beer haven, Bryan knew it must be the very same place of which Donald had spoken too. He knew instinctively that it was his responsibility to bring the two Dons together. On a fateful summer afternoon at the Elysian Brewery on Capitol Hill, the two Dons met. The event later became known as THE HAPPY HOUR OF DESTINY.\r\n\r\nEvery patron in the pub knew something special was happening that day. The magical place both men dreamed of was one and the same. That very afternoon, the two Dons vowed to create a great beer haven right here on earth, and together they would name this magic place THE NAKED CITY. In THE NAKED CITY, it doesn't matter where you're going or where you've been, all that matters is great living and great beer. In THE NAKED CITY, the only problem is what great craft beer to try next. The two Dons spent a combined 25 years studying the world's great brewing traditions, and couldn't wait to begin experimenting together. Their very first batch of beer, an Oak-aged double IPA, took a ribbon in the Northwest regionals of the 2007 National Homebrew Competition. The rest, as they say, is history.\r\n\r\nTwo years after the two Dons combined their separate dreams, THE NAKED CITY opened its doors. Now Naked City boasts an award-winning brewery that produces a variety of small-batch beers available at the pub and friendly bars and restaurants in Seattle, Tacoma, Bellingham, and beyond. The 24 taps of THE NAKED CITY offer a constantly rotating variety of Washington's best beers, regional craft beers, and the best beers Donald and Don have found in two lifetimes of beer travels around the world.\r\n\r\nTwo and a half years after THE NAKED CITY was founded, the Dons convinced the local poet who brought them together to join them in the adventure. The Dons and Bryan together built a bigger brewery; a full-size kitchen; a dining room/movie theatre called The Screening Room that features free monthly events including film, comedy, poetry, community discusssion, and jazz; and now The Walrus Beer Garden, a patio that's home to murals by local artists, games, and summertime events.\r\n\r\nSo.

We set sail in December 2009, during the height of a global economic storm, and have quickly become one of the fastest growing breweries in Washington, with our beer is now sacking and pillaging cities throughout Washington and British Columbia. We have taken a different tack than many new brewers, and rather than going for a number of very big, single batch beers, we are focused on food-friendly beers in a smaller lineup that is readily available year round. We realized a long time ago that food-friendly by no means needs to be less flavorful, and we actually add ingredients to widen the palate of our beers above and beyond their original styles.\r\n\r\nTo better integrate with a meal and make our beers more ‘sessionable’ in general, we utilize highly attenuating yeasts to dry out our beers to make them less sweet and filling, then replace that desired sweetness with an addition outside the norm, such as Juniper, Ginger or even Angelica. These ingredients are always kept at a level to avoid building a ‘spice beer’, and always present themselves as a unique and complementary addition. We also focus on extremely clean finishes, and use the entire recipe to build bittering rather than just using the hops to reduce lingering starchiness.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the true beauty of any flavor is in the eye (and mouth) of the beholder. Read about our beers here, then taste them at your local restaurant or store and judge for yourself if we have truly crafted ‘Great Beer Designed With Great Food In Mind’.

We usually do not brew the same beer twice, but will do so if enough people ask.\r\n\r\nBy definition, an outlander is a stranger, a foreigner, but here he is much more. This is how we see him: The outlander is the innovator; he is the one who drives change. It is the outlander, whether in mind or origin, who represents the ambitious, passionate pioneer who is willing to put everything on the line in order to make his dream come true. It’s often a simple dream, a dream to share his knowledge, his expertise with the ones who call him stranger. And certainly the public may reject his ideas, they may cast him back to where he came from. But does this ever worry the outlander? Never. Because the outlander believes in his ideas. He knows what he is offering is great and he knows others, once they put aside their prejudice, will know this too. He knows that someone who has invested their time, their life, their hopes and dreams behind something cannot fail. And he knows one last vital piece of information– that there have been many outlanders in this world before him and there will be many more to come.","latitude":47.652227,"longitude":-122.3555637,"images":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4iDXFJ/upload_pLt4tJ-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4iDXFJ/upload_pLt4tJ-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4iDXFJ/upload_pLt4tJ-large.png"},"beerIds":[]},{"id":"19nM2n","breweryId":"AOYRfm","breweryName":"Burdick Brewery","breweryDescription":"We are a company dedicated to creating great beer and hosting a creative space for others.
