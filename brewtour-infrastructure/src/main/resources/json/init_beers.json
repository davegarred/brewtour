This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or light caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile.

With the assistance of Loki, Thor quickly discovered that his hammer had been stolen by Thrym, the king of a race of Giants, and that his only means of retrieval of Mjolnir, was to have Freya agree to become Thrym’s wife.  Now while Freya was promiscuous, even she had her standards, and after refusing to take part in the exchange, Thor dressed in a bridal gown and veil and presented himself in the role of Freya.  Thrym bought in to the ruse, and upon presenting Mjolnir to Freya (secretly Thor) in the exchange, Thor threw off the veil and gown and destroyed the Giants en masse.  I guess what we are trying to say, is that behind our beer’s thinly veiled and beautiful facade, lay a full bodied ale that can pack a punch!\r\n\r\nThor’s Equinox – Belgian Strong Ale is a brew that is big in flavor without the chewy body holding you back from finishing the whole glass.

Note that the \"traditional\" style of this beer has its origins with certain floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American hop varietals. One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"42","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.6","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,25,18],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}},{"breweryId":"IaQrxj","id":"SJ06xd","name":"Donkey Deux Belgian Double","description":"Donkey Deux Belgian Double","abv":"8.4","ibu":"30","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":58,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,43,5],"updateDate":[2015,6,2,20,36,15],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/SJ06xd/upload_0k4LWs-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/SJ06xd/upload_0k4LWs-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/SJ06xd/upload_0k4LWs-large.png"},"style":{"id":58,"categoryId":5,"name":"Belgian-Style Dubbel","shortName":"Belgian Dubbel","description":"This medium-bodied, red to dark brown colored ale has a malty sweetness and chocolate-like caramel aroma.

Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character.
