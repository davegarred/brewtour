This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,46,56],"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}},{"breweryId":"WF34ng","id":"ujrCRp","name":"Fleur d' Elise","description":"This Farmhouse Style Ale, also known as a saison, was brewed with Orris Root, Grains of Paradise & primed with Wild Flower Honey.","abv":"6.3","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":72,"glasswareId":13,"createDate":[2014,9,17,22,21,34],"updateDate":[2015,12,17,18,0,44],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/ujrCRp/upload_7sCgBh-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/ujrCRp/upload_7sCgBh-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/ujrCRp/upload_7sCgBh-large.png"},"style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

These fresh Cascades overwhelm Thundercone with an earthy, raw, hop-decadence that can only come from fresh hops.  It is a greener and more unadulterated flavor and aroma than comes from dried hops.  The citrusy, flowery and grapefruit notes usually associated with Cascade hops are still present but with an amazing fresh hop funkiness added into the mix.

It is a solar festival, observed when the length of night and day (on the equator, at least) are equal, striking a perfect balance between dark and light. Workingman’s Red is an exceptional beer for the occasion, since its reddish hue strikes a perfect balance between the darker beers of winter and the lighter beers of summer. Its flavor is also perfectly balanced between the sweetness derived from malted barley and the bitterness derived from whole hop cones.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Red style was first brewed in Ireland by Franciscan monks sometime in the 14th century, which was long before stout became the national drink. The use of unmalted roasted barley reflected the Irish tradition of dodging British-imposed malt taxes while adding depth and complexity to the ale's character. It gained appeal as a restorative brew to slake the thirsts of farm hands at harvest time and, later, industrial workers after a day in the factory. An exceptionally drinkable quality characterized this ale. The same can be said for Workingman’s Red, which has a deep mahogany color and a slight, malty sweetness up front. This rich foundation and flavor is surprisingly smooth due to the perfect balance of noble hop flavors. It finishes with a toasty mouth feel and a bold, aromatic hop character that compliments the up front sweetness exquisitely.\r\n\r\nWorkingman’s Red is flavorful enough to satisfy discerning tastes, but still quaffable enough to quench the mighty thirst of the workingman.

Originally created at the Thompson Brewery over 20 years ago on October 15, 1991 and made by all Thompson Brewers to come after, Black Widow has become an expected and welcome Halloween treat at the Thompson Public House in Salem.  More recently Black Widow has expanded her web to include other breweries and outposts in the last few years.  This year, however, her web has enveloped the entire company, as every McMenamins brewery will be making a batch.  Preparing for this year’s brew, ale-houses warmed to the task with vats of striking hot water.  Mysterious sacks of grain were shuffled to steaming mash cauldrons.  Madcap laughs were heard in darkened aging-cellars and Thompson’s stairway to nowhere.  And brewers bared fangs as well as souls in the ritual preparation of this year’s Halloween brew.\r\n\r\nEach deep-black goblet of Black Widow is packed full of the robust notes afforded by generous amounts of black and roast malts and further spirited with ethereal wisps of caramel and licorice.  Both substantial and sublime, this elixir is sure to slake the most fiendish of thirsts.  Open up a creaking pub door, find a seat with friends and family, and nourish your inner ghoul with a brew steeped in tradition and mystery.

Eagle Harbor is the bay that Downtown Winslow adjoins and the location of the ferry terminal. Interestingly, Winslow was not the main settlement on the island for much of its history. Searching for a new harbor to build ever larger ships, in 1903 the Hall Brothers Shipyard relocated from Port Blakely to Eagle Harbor. The tiny settlement of Madrone was then renamed Winslow, after the deceased Winslow Hall. Eagle Harbor IPA is named for that fading dream of enormous five-masted schooners, sailing to distant shores.","abv":"6","ibu":"60","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":30,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,9,15,13,20,11],"updateDate":[2015,12,16,19,19,20],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/vPNu3b/upload_wnREfv-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/vPNu3b/upload_wnREfv-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/vPNu3b/upload_wnREfv-large.png"},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

With the assistance of Loki, Thor quickly discovered that his hammer had been stolen by Thrym, the king of a race of Giants, and that his only means of retrieval of Mjolnir, was to have Freya agree to become Thrym’s wife.  Now while Freya was promiscuous, even she had her standards, and after refusing to take part in the exchange, Thor dressed in a bridal gown and veil and presented himself in the role of Freya.  Thrym bought in to the ruse, and upon presenting Mjolnir to Freya (secretly Thor) in the exchange, Thor threw off the veil and gown and destroyed the Giants en masse.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors.

Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.

Available in 22-ounce bottles and on draft, it promises to be an unavoidable reminder of something intense and darkly delicious.\r\n\r\nThe Dread is the latest addition to the dark side of the Elysian canon of beers, an Imperial Stout aged for two months on oak. It snaps at the heels of Omen Belgian-style Raspberry Stout, and will in turn be followed by other dark beers of haunting complexity, suitable to be laid down but delicious right now.\r\n\r\nThe Dread was brewed to 9.2% alcohol by volume with a grist of pale, C-77 Crystal, black and chocolate malts with roasted barley, flaked rye and sugar.

So, in the sunny summer of 2003, we created Leavenworth Light, the Northwest’s first craft-brewed light bier.\r\n\r\nA thirst quencher of Alpine proportions, Leavenworth Light is generously flavorful with precious few calories. Its secret? To ample portions of Pilsen and Ashburne Mild malts we add just a touch of Munich malt. These three provide a distinct malt foundation that’s long on flavor, yet remarkably short of calories and carbohydrates. We then hop with US Goldings. What results is well balanced, superbly flavorful bier. But calories? Fat chance: Leavenworth Light has just 75. On trail or off, its crisply malty flavor places Leavenworth Light among the best outdoor refreshments.

The ale was so good and the response to it so overwhelmingly positive that it has become the crown jewel of REEL ALEs.\r\n\r\nTen different hops: Horizon, Chinook, Columbus, Willamette, Tradition, Northern Brewer, Santiam, Tettnanger, Cascade and Golding, in the order of their use -- give Ten Squared a unique hop character which has to be tasted to be believed.\r\n\r\nEven with 100 IBUs, this brew sports a strong malt backbone. Two-row Pale, Caramel 40, Caramel 75, Special B and Aromatic malts impart remarkable balance for such a hop monster. This is smooth ale with surprising similarities to ten year old malt whiskey.","abv":"10","ibu":"100","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":34,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,36],"updateDate":[2015,12,15,23,35,33],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Ml1FV3/upload_FAbrWH-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Ml1FV3/upload_FAbrWH-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Ml1FV3/upload_FAbrWH-large.png"},"style":{"id":34,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"American Barleywine","description":"American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness. Complexity of alcohols and fruity-ester characters are often high and counterbalanced by assertive bitterness and extraordinary alcohol content. Hop aroma and flavor are at medium to very high levels. American type hops are often used but not necessary for this style. Very low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. A caramel and/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably.
