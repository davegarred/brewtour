{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"6zQbFx","name":"Sloan Stout","description":"Beer partner to Stuart stout, this stout is quite different, yet equally as bold.  We used the same yeast used to make Guinness and tried to mimic the water profile of Dublin, Ireland to create our own interpretation of a dry stout, a style that Guinness has made ever so popular.  Sloan stout has a bold roast character, like the Stuart, but it has a drier finish, featuring the roast character and malts much more. The yeast also kicked off some subtle fruity notes complementing its roasty character.  A great beer where the roast and malt character stand for themselves, as they should in a dry stout.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":23,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,4,15,18,23,51],"updateDate":[2015,6,5,15,21,3],"style":{"id":23,"categoryId":2,"name":"Classic Irish-Style Dry Stout","shortName":"Dry Irish Stout","description":"Dry stouts have an initial malt and light caramel flavor profile with a distinctive dry-roasted bitterness in the finish. Dry stouts achieve a dry-roasted character through the use of roasted barley. The emphasis of coffee-like roasted barley and a moderate degree of roasted malt aromas define much of the character. Some slight acidity may be perceived but is not necessary. European hop aroma and flavor should be low or not perceived. Dry stouts have medium-light to medium body. Fruity esters are minimal and overshadowed by malt, high hop bitterness, and roasted barley character. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be very low or not perceived. Head retention and rich character should be part of its visual character.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,23,51],"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
