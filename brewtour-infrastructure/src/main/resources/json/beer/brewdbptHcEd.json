{"breweryId":"pu2Dtc","id":"ptHcEd","name":"Make It So!","description":"An homage to the Captain. This English-style ale is built on an American 2-Row base with biscuit, aromatic, and a bit of caramel malt.  We ferment this ale first, then infuse it with locally sourced Earl Grey tea and let it condition a little bit longer to integrate the flavors.  Instead of using any bittering hops, we rely on the tea to give this brew itâ€™s bitters.  Complemented by just a touch of Tettnanger hops to accentuate the bergamot.
