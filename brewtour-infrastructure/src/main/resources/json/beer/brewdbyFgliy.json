{"breweryId":"biGe6O","id":"yFgliy","name":"Best Bitter ESB","description":"An English style pale ale that is copper colored and emphasizes the subtle blend of imported and domestic malts.  Hops are in the background in this beer meant for everyday drinking.  Although the name is still misleading to some people, this ale is designed to capture the traditional flavor of English \"Bitter,\" which is a beer of great subtlety, never harsh or particularly bitter at all.","abv":"5.6","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":4,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,47],"updateDate":[2015,3,2,20,10,53],"style":{"id":4,"categoryId":1,"name":"Special Bitter or Best Bitter","shortName":"Special Bitter","description":"Special bitter is more robust than ordinary bitter. It has medium body and medium residual malt sweetness. It is deep gold to copper colored. Hop bitterness should be medium and absent of harshness. Hop flavor and aroma character may be evident at the brewer's discretion. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels. The absence of diacetyl is also acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)","ibuMin":"28","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.1","abvMax":"4.8","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,19,15],"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
