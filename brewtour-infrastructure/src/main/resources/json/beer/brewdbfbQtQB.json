{"breweryId":"o4FfAx","id":"fbQtQB","name":"Saison","description":"No cork or wire cage here. Weâ€™re getting back to the spirit of a Saison as a beer you can drink every day, not just special occasions. Refreshing and complex, the high fermentation temperature used with the Belgian yeast strain allows it to add its unique characteristics to the flavor without the addition of spices. Saisons are a great style that can be appreciated by both the informed and informal beer drinker.","abv":"6.6","ibu":"20","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":72,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,44,8],"updateDate":[2015,12,16,10,30,15],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/fbQtQB/upload_xMV2iB-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/fbQtQB/upload_xMV2iB-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/fbQtQB/upload_xMV2iB-large.png"},"style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color. There may be quite a variety of characters within this style. Generally: They are light to medium in body. Malt aroma is low to medium-low. Esters are medium to high in  aroma, while, complex alcohols, herbs, spices, low Brettanomyces character and even clove and smoke-like phenolics may or may not be evident in the overall balanced beer. Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.055","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,34,55],"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
