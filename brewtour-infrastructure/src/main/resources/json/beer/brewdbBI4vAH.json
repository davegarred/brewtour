{"breweryId":"V8LP7a","id":"BI4vAH","name":"Midgard Serpent Double IPA","description":"There is only a  limited supply Midgard Serpent Double IPA available at our taproom and select accounts.  This 8.1% abv and 80 IBU beer is designed with a simple and elegant grain bill of Pale and Caramel malts to complement, but not interfere with, the intense hop expression. We then utilized 7 different hop additions in the mash, kettle, whirlpool and fermenter to best highlight the various flavors and aromas of Columbus, Cascade, Bravo, and Falconerâ€™s Flight.  This beer will battle your taste buds and see your enemies driven before you.","abv":"8","ibu":"85","isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":31,"srmId":9,"createDate":[2015,7,28,19,30,58],"updateDate":[2015,7,28,19,30,58],"style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma. Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,26,46],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"srm":{"id":9,"name":"9","hex":"E58500"}}
