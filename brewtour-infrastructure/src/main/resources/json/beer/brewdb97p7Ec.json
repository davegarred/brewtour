{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"97p7Ec","name":"Phantom Falls","description":"This beer has a base of a belgo style pale ale. The malts are simple, creating a basic pale ale, while the yeast imparted a Belgian character. We used fresh cascade hops that have a delicate floral/citrus character that blends with the yeast character.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":62,"glasswareId":6,"createDate":[2012,4,15,18,34,21],"updateDate":[2012,4,15,18,34,21],"style":{"id":62,"categoryId":5,"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale","description":"Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Light to medium body and low malt aroma are typical. They are light amber to deep amber in color. Noble-type hops are commonly used. Low to medium fruity esters are evident in aroma and flavor. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may be perceived. Low caramel or toasted malt flavor is okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"30","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"12","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,32,6],"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
