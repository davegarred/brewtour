{"breweryId":"17tUiZ","id":"G0MJTQ","name":"Decade India Pale Ale","description":"Our special 10th anniversary beer is the biggest IPA we have had the nerve to make. Almost all Pale malt, with less than one percent each of Carastan and Wheat makes a beer quite pale for its size at 19 plato OG. We added Chinook, Centennial and Cascade hops just about every place and every way we could think of - giving it lots of hop flavor and aroma and enough bitterness to complement the telltale sweetness of the malt. One patron says \"It makes you smile so your mouth's big enough for the beer\". 6.25% alcohol by weight 7.8% by volume.","abv":"7.8","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":30,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,43,4],"updateDate":[2012,3,22,13,5,19],"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
