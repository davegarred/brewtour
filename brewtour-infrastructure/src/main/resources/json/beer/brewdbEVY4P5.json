{"breweryId":"h6TO1Z","id":"EVY4P5","name":"Turnaround Red","description":"The turnaround is the last few notes of the blues progression, the cadence at the end of the phrase which sets up the next verse.\r\n\r\nRed ales have a long tradition in the Northwest, and have diverged significantly from their Irish red roots. The Northwest-style red has a complex hop aroma balanced by the use of lots of caramel malts, which provide a sweeter taste and give the beer its distinctive red color.\r\n\r\nTBB's Northwest Red Ale is copper going on ruby red, with a slightly sweeter feel than the rest of our beers. The malt gives the beer a pleasant medium caramel flavor. Six different hops are used in this beer, including Chinook which adds a Northwest outdoors pine aroma, a strong homage to the style.","abv":"5.7","ibu":"45","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":32,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,9,8,11,21,48],"updateDate":[2014,10,16,19,16,40],"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Amber/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.
