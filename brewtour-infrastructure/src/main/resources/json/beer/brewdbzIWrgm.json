{"breweryId":"187kFc","id":"zIWrgm","name":"Quercus et Cerasus","description":"First in a series of small-batch sour beer collaborations that Beertender Dale and Assistant Brewer Zach have planned for 2015. This American take on a Flanders Red Ale was sour mashed with Lactobacillus Brevis, and aged on Pinot Noir soaked oak-spirals; dried Bing cherries; and dried figs. It’s well-balanced and approachable, yet complex and tart enough to satisfy the sour heads. Why Latin? Because that’s the language Flemish monks would have spoken when they developed this style in the 1700s.","abv":"6.7","ibu":"15","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":3,"styleId":32,"createDate":[2015,3,6,21,47,13],"updateDate":[2015,3,6,21,47,13],"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Amber/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color. They are characterized by American-variety hops used to produce the perception of medium hop bitterness, flavor, and medium aroma. Amber ales have medium-high to high maltiness with medium to low caramel character. They should have medium to medium-high body. The style may have low levels of fruityester flavor and aroma. Diacetyl can be either absent or barely perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Slight yeast haze is acceptable for bottle-conditioned products.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"11","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.048","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,26,52],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not available."}}
