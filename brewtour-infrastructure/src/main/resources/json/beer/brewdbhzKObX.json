{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"hzKObX","name":"Hannegan Red","description":"Hannegan Red is typical Irish Red in honor of St Patrick’s day.  It has a very simple malt bill with just enough munich, crystal (80L), roast, and flaked barley to give it some color and a little complexity. With very little hop character (this isn’t your NW style red), the Irish yeast imparts more of an impact on the beer: a slight fruitiness but overall smooth, clean character.  Overall, Hannegan has an initial sweetness with light fruity notes yielding to an easy drinking pint, perfect for any Irish celebration.","abv":"4.6","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":22,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,4,15,18,43,28],"updateDate":[2015,4,24,15,2,55],"style":{"id":22,"categoryId":2,"name":"Irish-Style Red Ale","shortName":"Irish Red","description":"Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.
