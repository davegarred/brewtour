{"breweryId":"NUZvIK","id":"JWaWkp","name":"DWIght","description":"DWIght is a Dark Wheat IPA. We used three different wheat types (white wheat malt, flaked wheat, and midnight wheat) for the grain bill. Fermented with American Wheat yeast, to give the hints of banana and clove. We then dry hopped this beer with a ton of Chinook hops. It's definitely a different beer, try it, let us know your thoughts.","abv":"5.2","ibu":"50","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":115,"createDate":[2015,3,6,21,54,16],"updateDate":[2015,3,6,21,54,16],"style":{"id":115,"categoryId":11,"name":"Dark American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Dark Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent malt wheat, and hop rates may be low to medium. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is intended to be served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"9","srmMax":"22","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,44,1],"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."}}
