{"breweryId":"vR4nXO","id":"ygPEjC","name":"Joker Ale","description":"This bold amber is hoppy and unfiltered in the classic Pacific Northwest Style. We combine premium 2-Row and Crystal malts to form a pleasant malty base, then add enough Cascade and Centennial hops to create a balanced beer with a citrusy hop finish. This beer is easy to enjoy by itself and pairs well with most foods.","abv":"6","ibu":"40","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":32,"glasswareId":4,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,43,32],"updateDate":[2015,12,16,6,44,23],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/ygPEjC/upload_ZiqCuY-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/ygPEjC/upload_ZiqCuY-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/ygPEjC/upload_ZiqCuY-large.png"},"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Amber/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.
