{"breweryId":"NUZvIK","id":"ATkxD8","name":"Dark Rooted Blonde","description":"Our first Founder Collaboration Beer. The five members that were randomly chosen to brew this beer with the brewers chose to do a Tripel. The brewers thought instead of the traditional Belgian Candi syrup used in belgians to give more fermentables, we would use locally sourced honey. The name is dutch, translated to english is Honey Love. The malt is mostly Pilsner malet with just a small amount of vienna added for character. Hops used were Hallertau and Saaz. Then 10lbs per beer barrel were added after the boil. Fermented with a Trappist High Gravity yeast.","abv":"8.4","ibu":"30","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":61,"createDate":[2015,3,6,21,57,11],"updateDate":[2015,3,6,21,57,11],"style":{"id":61,"categoryId":5,"name":"Belgian-Style Blonde Ale","shortName":"Belgian Blonde","description":"Belgian-style blond ales are characterized by low yet evident hop bitterness, flavor, and sometimes aroma.
