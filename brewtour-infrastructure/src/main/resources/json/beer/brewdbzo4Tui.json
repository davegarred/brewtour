{"breweryId":"GC3a1f","id":"zo4Tui","name":"Dick's Danger Ale","description":"Our flagship beer. A large percentage of black malt gives this distinctive ale its dark brown/black color and that slightly roasted flavor. Magnum hops provide a backbone of bitterness and large additions of Mt. Hood hops later in the boil come right through in the finish.\r\n\r\nThe result is a highly drinkable, non-intrusive dark ale which defies style guidelines and leaves you wanting more.","abv":"5.2","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":37,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,43,3],"updateDate":[2015,12,15,20,33,21],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/zo4Tui/upload_smISYh-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/zo4Tui/upload_smISYh-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/zo4Tui/upload_smISYh-large.png"},"style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color. Roasted malt caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be of medium intensity in both flavor and aroma. American brown ales have evident low to medium hop flavor and aroma, medium to high hop bitterness, and a medium body. Estery and fruity-ester characters should be subdued. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"6.4","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"26","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,27,35],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
