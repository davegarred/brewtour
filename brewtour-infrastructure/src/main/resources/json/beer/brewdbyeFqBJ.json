{"breweryId":"tIgHYj","id":"yeFqBJ","name":"Gold Mt. Pilsner","description":"A pilsner, more than any other beer, expresses the quality and craftsmanship of a brewery. Attention to every detail from ingredients, process and cellaring must be exact for it's clear subtle flavors to meld perfectly. Any flaw or blemish is immediately apparent. When you taste Gold Mt. Pilsner you taste the very best from the brewers at Silver City. It is with great pride that we are making this classic European style lager available as our newest seasonal beer starting this summer from July till September. \r\n\r\nBrewed with North American lager malt and Czechoslovakian hops and yeast, Gold Mountain Pilsner beautifully blends old world and new. A lagering period (cold storage) of 4 to 6 weeks allows this most delicate of brews to become bright and clear. At this time, the malt character is now fully developed and the entire beer has lost its rough edges becoming soft and elegant. The perfect pint for a warm summers day or any day for that matter, Gold Mt. Pilsner rewards with clean, crisp, quaffable flavor every time. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nBronze Medal - Great American Beer Festival - 2009\r\nGold Medal - Great American Beer Festival - 2006","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":98,"glasswareId":4,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,43,16],"updateDate":[2012,3,22,13,5,37],"style":{"id":98,"categoryId":8,"name":"American-Style Pilsener","shortName":"American Pilsener","description":"This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color.
