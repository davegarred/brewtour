{"breweryId":"ZC15x9","id":"T0B8fy","name":"Blackbeard Dark Lager","description":"While almost opaque, Blackbeard Dark Lager is remarkably light in character.  Itâ€™s deep color comes from a complex variety of malts making the beer almost sweet rather than bitter.  The chocolate finish is crisp and clean across the palate.  It complements a wide variety of foods.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":103,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,51],"updateDate":[2012,3,22,13,5,34],"style":{"id":103,"categoryId":8,"name":"American-Style Dark Lager","shortName":"American Dark Lager","description":"This beer's malt aroma and flavor are low but notable. Its color ranges from a very deep copper to a deep, dark brown. It has a clean, light body with discreet contributions from caramel and roasted malts. Non-malt adjuncts are often used, and hop rates are low. Hop bitterness is clean and has a short duration of impact. Hop flavor, and aroma are low. Carbonation is high. Fruity esters, diacetyl, and chill haze should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"14","ibuMax":"20","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"14","srmMax":"25","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,41,42],"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
