Northwest hops add a non-traditional citrus and resin character to result in a rich, yet surprisingly light and smooth dark ale.","abv":"4.8","ibu":"37","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":84,"createDate":[2015,1,12,22,27,51],"updateDate":[2015,1,15,19,55,34],"style":{"id":84,"categoryId":7,"name":"German-Style Schwarzbier","shortName":"Schwarzbier","description":"These very dark brown to black beers have a mild roasted malt character without the associated bitterness. This is not a fullbodied beer, but rather a moderate body gently enhances malt flavor and aroma with low to moderate levels of sweetness. Hop bitterness is low to medium in character. Noble-type hop flavor and aroma should be low but perceptible. There should be no fruity esters. Diacetyl should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"22","ibuMax":"30","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"25","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,37,12],"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}}}
