{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"r29y9E","name":"Esmeralda Ale","description":"Esmeralda is a complementary beer to it’s mountainBeer partner Maude’s mild; similar qualities but slightly different vital statistics.  It has a similar base to the mild, but it was brewed to a higher alcohol level.  Also, instead of dark fruits, we brewed this with some dark sugars allowing notes of molasses and dark sugar to complement the extra alcohol.  Esmeralda was fermented with an English yeast adding a smooth fruity flavor on top of the alcohol and molasses tones.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":10,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,4,15,18,41,28],"updateDate":[2012,4,15,18,41,28],"style":{"id":10,"categoryId":1,"name":"English-Style Pale Mild Ale","shortName":"English Pale Mild","description":"English pale mild ales range from golden to amber in color.
