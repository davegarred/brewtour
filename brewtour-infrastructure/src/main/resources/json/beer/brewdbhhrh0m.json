{"breweryId":"CFmMeZ","id":"hhrh0m","name":"DirtyFace Amber","description":"Finally, a beer that pays homage to the hard working folks in our Valley; the trail crews and farmers, the lumberjacks and firefighters, we brew this for you. With a thirsty throat in mind, weâ€™ve created an amber lager that features a smooth, medium body, with a rich toasted malt aroma. The initial malty sweetness finishes fresh and clean... unlike its name. No need to wash up, just wash down.","abv":"5","isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":32,"createDate":[2015,7,24,20,31,25],"updateDate":[2015,7,24,20,31,25],"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Amber/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.

Amber ales have medium-high to high maltiness with medium to low caramel character. They should have medium to medium-high body. The style may have low levels of fruityester flavor and aroma. Diacetyl can be either absent or barely perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.
