{"breweryId":"Zwlamt","id":"Z7RTx6","name":"Magnus Oatmeal Milk Chocolate Stout","description":"Full of body and full of flavor. Take a rich, dark stout and add a touch of the sweetness of milk chocolate. A perfect blend of dark cocoa and hops for bitterness mixed with lactose and oats to add a smooth creamy mouth feel and a kiss of roasted coffee. Make a beer float out of it, put it in that chocolate cake recipe or drink it straight.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":21,"createDate":[2014,9,23,17,22,14],"updateDate":[2014,10,30,19,51,36],"style":{"id":21,"categoryId":1,"name":"Oatmeal Stout","shortName":"Oatmeal Stout","description":"Oatmeal stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy. A roasted malt character which is caramel-like and chocolate-like should be evident - smooth and not bitter. Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas (chocolate and nut-like) are prominent. Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels. Original gravity range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"20","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,22,53],"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}}}
