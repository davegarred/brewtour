{"breweryId":"M7BRN4","id":"aXyDcH","name":"Brave American","description":"An American Brown Ale that is an exceptional choice for the Northwest craft beer drinker.  This deep coppery brown ale has a toasty caramel flavor with an evident, but not overpowering, hop aroma.  There is a well balanced bitterness that doesn't linger, but transitions to a very clean finish with just a subtle hint of citrus from dry hopping.  A perfect ale for year round enjoyment!","abv":"6.5","ibu":"65","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":37,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,7,2,1,55,27],"updateDate":[2015,12,16,16,45,27],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/aXyDcH/upload_29vCQJ-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/aXyDcH/upload_29vCQJ-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/aXyDcH/upload_29vCQJ-large.png"},"style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.

Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"6.4","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"26","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,27,35],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
