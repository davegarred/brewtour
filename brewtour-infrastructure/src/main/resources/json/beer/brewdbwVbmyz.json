{"breweryId":"N7gSdA","id":"wVbmyz","name":"Black Frog Stout","description":"Brewed in the spirit of classic Irish Stouts, our Snoqualmie Falls Irish Oatmeal Stout has many of the same ingredients, including un-malted roasted barley to give it that semi-acidic roasted tang. To be different, we then use chocolate malt to produce an espresso character and finally use the unique ingredient of rolled oats rather than flaked barley. When used in the mash the rolled oats produce a silky smooth mouth feel which, when combined with the special nitrogen pouring technique, gives this great stout its smooth texture.","abv":"4.8","ibu":"28","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":21,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,11,3,16,41,42],"updateDate":[2012,11,3,16,41,42],"style":{"id":21,"categoryId":1,"name":"Oatmeal Stout","shortName":"Oatmeal Stout","description":"Oatmeal stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy. A roasted malt character which is caramel-like and chocolate-like should be evident - smooth and not bitter. Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas (chocolate and nut-like) are prominent. Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels. Original gravity range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"20","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,22,53],"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
