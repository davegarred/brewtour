{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"TLsmIf","name":"Maude's Mild","description":"Maude’s mild is our interpretation of a winter session beer. Milds are, by definition, a lower strength beer and Maude doesn’t venture from that.  However we used malts that would add complexity to the beer, which manifested in dark fruit characters in the beer – notes of prunes and raisins. This dark fruit character is the defining feature of this lower alcohol, easy drinking winter session beer.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":10,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,4,15,18,42,3],"updateDate":[2012,4,15,18,42,3],"style":{"id":10,"categoryId":1,"name":"English-Style Pale Mild Ale","shortName":"English Pale Mild","description":"English pale mild ales range from golden to amber in color.
