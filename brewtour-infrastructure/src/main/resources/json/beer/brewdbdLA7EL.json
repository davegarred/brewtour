{"breweryId":"uHVh1e","id":"dLA7EL","name":"Morrighan Stout","description":"The Morrighan was a Celtic goddess of war that would sometimes take the form of a raven in battle. Our Morrighan takes the form of deliciousness in a glass instead. Brewed in the classic dry Irish stout style, this black brew delivers a punch of flavor without weighing you down. Starts with flavors of dark caramel, chocolate and light roast and then ends with a roasted coffee-like finish. Dispensed on nitro for a smooth and creamy pint.\r\n\r\nMalts: ESB, Crystal, Chocolate, Roast, Black\r\nHops: Glacier, Goldings","abv":"4.4","ibu":"36","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":23,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,43,44],"updateDate":[2012,3,22,13,5,41],"style":{"id":23,"categoryId":2,"name":"Classic Irish-Style Dry Stout","shortName":"Dry Irish Stout","description":"Dry stouts have an initial malt and light caramel flavor profile with a distinctive dry-roasted bitterness in the finish. Dry stouts achieve a dry-roasted character through the use of roasted barley. The emphasis of coffee-like roasted barley and a moderate degree of roasted malt aromas define much of the character. Some slight acidity may be perceived but is not necessary. European hop aroma and flavor should be low or not perceived. Dry stouts have medium-light to medium body. Fruity esters are minimal and overshadowed by malt, high hop bitterness, and roasted barley character. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be very low or not perceived. Head retention and rich character should be part of its visual character.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,23,51],"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
