{"breweryId":"Wsssvf","id":"6X2WSY","name":"American Wheat Ale","description":"American Wheat Ale is made with a high percentage of malted wheat, along with Pilsner malt, and modest hopping to deliver a smooth, light, drinkable beer. American Wheat Ale is hazy golden with a thick, white head. The aroma is light and grainy like fresh-baked bread. The flavor is light and crisp with a slightly sweet/tart, peachy finish from the use of aciduated malt.","abv":"5","ibu":"16","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"American Wheat Ale plays nicely with foods of all types.

It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. A fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Appearance can be clear or with chill haze, golden to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,42,53],"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
