{"breweryId":"MSt4zl","id":"KoUOXq","name":"Shimmergloom Stout","description":"A smooth, full-bodied oatmeal stout that pours with a creamy brown head and a body of deep, dark black that is as mesmerizing as it is terrifying. Shimmergloom will take wing to the night sky, blotting out the shimmering stars like a shadowy dragon on itâ€™s deleterious approach to burn your ramparts, crush your resistance and leave you wanting more. Shimmergloom won a bronze medal in the Irish/British Stout category at 2014 Washington Beer Awards.","abv":"6","ibu":"48","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":42,"createDate":[2015,8,6,21,11,39],"updateDate":[2015,8,6,21,11,39],"style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.
