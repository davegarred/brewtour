{"breweryId":"h9obbv","id":"FXCLKQ","name":"Cherenkov Cascadian Dark Ale","description":"Our Cherenkov Cascadian Dark Ale will catch your eye with its nearly black color. Next, enjoy the nose with previews of dark chocolate, coffee, smoky notes, and subtle hints of hops. On the tongue, the generous amounts of Northwest hops are balanced with a variety of dark malts. Don't let the color fool you, this is not an overly heavy beer.  85 IBU - 7.1% ABV.  Bottoms Up!","abv":"7.1","ibu":"85","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":116,"createDate":[2015,8,7,22,46,37],"updateDate":[2015,8,7,22,46,37],"style":{"id":116,"categoryId":11,"name":"Dark American Wheat Ale or Lager without Yeast","shortName":"Dark Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent malted wheat, and hop rates may be low to medium. A fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. Chill haze is also acceptable.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"9","srmMax":"22","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,44,7],"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}}}
