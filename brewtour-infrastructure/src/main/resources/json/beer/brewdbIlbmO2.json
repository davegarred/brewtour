Flavored malt beverages exhibit little or no traditional beer or malt beverage flavor characteristics. Their flavor is primarily derived from added flavoring rather than from malt and other materials used in fermentation. However,  flavored malt beverages are marketed in traditional beer bottles and cans and distributed to the alcohol beverage market through beer and malt beverage wholesalers. Their alcohol content is similar to other malt beverages – in the range of 4-6% alcohol by volume.","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"6","createDate":[2014,7,10,14,15,20],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,49,43],"category":{"id":14,"name":"Malternative Beverages","description":"Malternative Beverages, also known as \"ready-to-drink\" beverages, are sweet, sometime carbonated, beverages that are low in alcohol.","createDate":[2014,7,10,14,11,26]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."}}
