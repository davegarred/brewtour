{"breweryId":"CFmMeZ","id":"l2FWxL","name":"Khaos","description":"As the frigid water of Icicle Creek tumbles down the canyon, pouring over boulders, churning in eddies, foam and froth billowing from beneath, it dreams of one day becoming the greatest beer ever. A German Ale that delicately balances subtle fruit flavors and aromas with a subdued maltiness, a beer that’s fresh like an alpine spring and as crisp as a mountain breeze. It dreams of brewing up to be the downright drinkable, Khaos Kolsch.","abv":"5","ibu":"21","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":3,"styleId":45,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2013,1,23,1,25,34],"updateDate":[2015,6,4,20,32,13],"style":{"id":45,"categoryId":4,"name":"German-Style Kölsch / Köln-Style Kölsch","shortName":"Kölsch","description":"Kölsch is warm fermented and aged at cold temperatures (German ale or alt-style beer). Kölsch is characterized by a golden to straw color and a slightly dry, subtly sweet softness on the palate, yet crisp. Good, dense head retention is desirable. Light pearapple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Caramel character should not be evident. The body is light to medium-light. This beer has low hop flavor and aroma with medium bitterness. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all. Chill haze should be absent.","ibuMin":"18","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.3","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"6","ogMin":"1.042","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,29,4],"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not available."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
