{"breweryId":"biGe6O","id":"Ct8O1q","name":"Imperial IPA","description":"A full bodied, copper colored India Pale Ale with a strong alcohol content and an aggressive \"fresh hop\" finish.  Only in the great Northwest can you find such a well balanced, over the top, highly hopped draft ale.  This beer won the Alpha King challenge in 2006 and 2nd place in 2008 - the only brewery from Washington to bring home the Alpha King title so far!","abv":"9","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":31,"glasswareId":2,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,43,27],"updateDate":[2015,12,16,6,4,2],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Ct8O1q/upload_ZjTWo1-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Ct8O1q/upload_ZjTWo1-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Ct8O1q/upload_ZjTWo1-large.png"},"style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma. Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,26,46],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"glass":{"id":2,"name":"Goblet","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
