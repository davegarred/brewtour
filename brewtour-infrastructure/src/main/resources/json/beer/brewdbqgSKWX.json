{"breweryId":"ZC15x9","id":"qgSKWX","name":"Blood Orange Wit","description":"The Wit comes at you with a nose of citrus infused spicy fresh bread. A cloudy orange-gold hued beer, its flavor is dominated by a huge blend of different orange zests and hand crushed whole coriander. This is no “soda” wit and will reward you with a rich creamy texture.","abv":"5.3","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":65,"glasswareId":4,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,52],"updateDate":[2015,12,16,12,39,23],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/qgSKWX/upload_5bgZJV-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/qgSKWX/upload_5bgZJV-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/qgSKWX/upload_5bgZJV-large.png"},"style":{"id":65,"categoryId":5,"name":"Belgian-Style White (or Wit) / Belgian-Style Wheat","shortName":"Witbier","description":"Belgian white ales are very pale in color and are brewed using unmalted wheat and malted barley and are spiced with coriander and orange peel. Coriander and light orange peel aroma should be perceived as such or as an unidentified spiciness. Phenolic spiciness and yeast flavors may be evident at mild levels. These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level. Mild acidity is appropriate.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"17","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.2","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,32,30],"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
