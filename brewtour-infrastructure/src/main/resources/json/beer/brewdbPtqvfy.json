Logistic limitations disappear as our collection of US hop varieties temporarily expand to include an International pot-pouri of hops from the United States, Europe, and the South Pacific.  These hops are scientifically chosen to provide an intense but clean bitterness and hop flavor appropriate for this style of Pale Ale.  Based on current understanding of hop chemistry and our desire to use the latest technology, we used pelletized hops to achieve the bitterness and liquid CO2 hop extracts for hop flavor.  The taste of this golden colored ale is dominated by hops, but contains an appropriate level of malt flavor as well.

One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins.
