{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"RDUGK0","name":"Copper Bitter","description":"We brewed this one with the summer in mind.  Contrasting to Redoubt red, this brew has a malty backbone with a nice, subtle bitterness that slightly lingers and complements the malt: exactly what a nice drinkable bitter should be.  Also, a nice fruity flavor (from both hops and yeast) presents itself in the background. We used standard English hops and a English style yeast to give this more of an authentic character, not a NW style bitter.  The result is a beer that you will want to drink all day long out on the deck basking in the sun.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":3,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,4,15,18,29,15],"updateDate":[2012,4,15,18,29,15],"style":{"id":3,"categoryId":1,"name":"Ordinary Bitter","shortName":"Bitter","description":"Ordinary bitter is gold to copper colored with medium bitterness, light to medium body, and low to medium residual malt sweetness. Hop flavor and aroma character may be evident at the brewer's discretion. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character and very low diacetyl (butterscotch) character are acceptable in aroma and flavor, but should be minimized in this form of bitter. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3","abvMax":"4.1","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"12","ogMin":"1.033","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,18,39],"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
