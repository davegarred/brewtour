{"breweryId":"qlT9u4","id":"c7VBTG","name":"Ceremony","description":"Ceremony - a farmhouse pale ale brewed with a large portion of oats, hopped with Citra and EKG, and fermented entirely with Brett. Ceremony is immensely hoppy, a torrent of citrus and stone fruit.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":27,"createDate":[2015,3,6,19,31,58],"updateDate":[2015,3,6,19,31,58],"style":{"id":27,"categoryId":3,"name":"Pale American-Belgo-Style Ale","shortName":"American/Belgian Pale","description":"These beers must portray the unique characters imparted by yeasts typically used in fruity and big Belgian-Style ales - These beers are not traditional Belgian styles which are already defined. They are unique beers unto themselves. Notes of banana, berry, apple, sometimes coriander spice-like and/or smoky-phenolic characters should be portrayed with balance of hops and malt character when fermented with such yeast. Hop aroma, flavor and bitterness not usually found in the base style, can be medium to very high and must show the characters of American hop varieties. Color falls in the blonde to amber range. Esters should be at medium to high levels. Diacetyl should not be evident. Chill haze may be evident. Sulfur-like yeast character should be absent.. No Brettanomyces character should be present. An ale which exhibits Brettanomyces character would be classified as \"American-style Brett Ale.\" A statement by the brewer that could include information such as style being elaborated upon, and other information about the entry with regard to flavor, aroma or appearance, is essential for fair assessment in competitions. Beers with Brettanomyces may be subcategorized under this category.","srmMin":"5","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,26,5],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}}}
