{"breweryId":"V8LP7a","id":"VJI40q","name":"Odin’s Gift","description":"The Norse culture of the early middle ages had a rich and complex set of gods.  The chief of all the Norse gods was Odin.  He is usually pictured as an old, long-haired and one-eyed wiseman, as legend holds that he sacrificed one of his eyes in order to drink from the fountain of all knowledge and wisdom.\r\n\r\nMore relevant to us however, Odin once transformed himself into an eagle and flew in to the land of men.  Sprinkling “magic dust” on some clay vessels that were storing the grain harvest from that year, this “magic dust,” along with some water transformed the grain into the first beer.  Hence, Odin gave the “Gift” of fermentation to mankind.  Our beer is a tribute to this rich and complex mythology and a ‘Thank you’ for his gift.\r\n\r\nOdin’s Gift – Nordic Amber Ale is a bold yet balanced filtered ale that can be paired with a variety of great foods or enjoyed by itself. It is brewed in small, hand-crafted batches with just the right amount of hops and juniper berries to deliver a unique and fresh aroma, flavor and finish","abv":"5.4","ibu":"28","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":32,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2013,7,27,14,56,25],"updateDate":[2013,7,27,14,56,25],"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Amber/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.
