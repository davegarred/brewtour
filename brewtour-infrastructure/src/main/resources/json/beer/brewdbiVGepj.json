Complexity of alcohols and fruity-ester characters are often high and counterbalanced by the perception of low to medium bitterness and extraordinary alcohol content. Hop aroma and flavor may be minimal to medium. English type hops are often used but not necessary for this style. Low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. Caramel and some characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and/or flavors, may be considered positive. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"40","ibuMax":"60","abvMin":"8.4","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"14","srmMax":"22","ogMin":"1.085","fgMin":"1.024","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,21,27],"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}}}
