{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"KJ3Cky","name":"Magic Brown","description":"Springtime is tricky for us, especially in Seattle. The first week of April brought near freezing weather and recently it has been warm and pleasant. We decided to cover all bases and made a brown and hoppy pale.  However, Magic Brown itself can fit the schizophrenic weather perfectly.  It is dark and malty for the cold, but it’s body is light enough that it will be great on a warmer day as well. Unlike the typical “brown,” we built this brown up to have some more residual malt character by adding some extra munich, caramunich, and other specialty malts, but keeping the overall alcohol content and roast character down.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":37,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,4,15,18,44,26],"updateDate":[2012,4,15,18,44,26],"style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color. Roasted malt caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be of medium intensity in both flavor and aroma. American brown ales have evident low to medium hop flavor and aroma, medium to high hop bitterness, and a medium body. Estery and fruity-ester characters should be subdued. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"6.4","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"26","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,27,35],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
