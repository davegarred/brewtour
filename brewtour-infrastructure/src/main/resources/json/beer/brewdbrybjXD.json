With this stately sense of pomp and tradition we bring you our Imperial Stout.\r\n\r\nThis robust black ale is full with rich dark caramel, unsweetened chocolate, and hints of coffee aromas and flavors. Stately indeed, but at 9.5% ABV, perhaps it is just a vain attempt to encourage the trickster spirit to act respectably.","abv":"9.5","ibu":"70","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":43,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,43,18],"updateDate":[2015,12,16,13,26,23],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/rybjXD/upload_RwWnah-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/rybjXD/upload_RwWnah-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/rybjXD/upload_RwWnah-large.png"},"style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content. Generally characterized as very robust. The extremely rich malty flavor and aroma are balanced with assertive hopping and fruity-ester characteristics. Bitterness should be moderately high to very high and balanced with full sweet malt character. Roasted malt astringency and bitterness can be moderately perceived but should not overwhelm the overall character. Hop aroma is usually moderately-high to overwhelmingly hop-floral, -citrus or -herbal. Diacetyl (butterscotch) levels should be absent.","ibuMin":"50","ibuMax":"80","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.08","fgMin":"1.02","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,28,49],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
