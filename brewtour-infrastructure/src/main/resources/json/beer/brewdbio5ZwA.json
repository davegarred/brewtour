{"breweryId":"h9obbv","id":"io5ZwA","name":"Szilard’s Vanilla Coffee Stout","description":"This Stout combines cold brewed coffee from Roasters Coffee, located here in Richland, and a grain combination that makes for a rich and dark full bodied flavor along with real vanilla beans added and soaked for five days. This is then finished off with a mild and earthy hop presence to make a complex combination of flavors that equally pleases all of the senses.  Named in honor of Leo Szilard, who conceived and patented nuclear chain reaction and the nuclear reactor in 1933.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":42,"createDate":[2015,8,7,22,50,59],"updateDate":[2015,8,7,22,50,59],"style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.
