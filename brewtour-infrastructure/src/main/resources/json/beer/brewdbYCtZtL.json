{"breweryId":"NfJcL9","id":"YCtZtL","name":"Republic Pale","description":"We proudly present our flagship West Coast Pale Ale. It’s a familiar and easy-drinking pint, but it packs a BIG fruity punch: oranges, grapefruits, apricots, green grapes, black currants, along with hints of pinecones and cracked peppercorns. It starts with a well-rounded malty flavor, is balanced by a great hoppy bitterness, and a tangy aftertaste which eventually finishes crisp and dry. It's hard to beat these home-grown Yakima valley hops. Our brewers’ favorite…and soon to become one of yours too.","abv":"5.8","ibu":"50","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":25,"createDate":[2015,3,13,18,24,14],"updateDate":[2015,3,13,18,24,14],"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color. The style is characterized by fruity, floral and citrus-like American-variety hop character producing medium to medium-high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Note that the \"traditional\" style of this beer has its origins with certain floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American hop varietals. One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"42","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.6","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,25,18],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."}}
