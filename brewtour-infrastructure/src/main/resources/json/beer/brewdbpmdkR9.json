{"breweryId":"5K9U34","id":"pmdkR9","name":"Oktoberfest Fall Fest","description":"Released in celebration of autumn’s arrival, Oktoberfest is a medium-bodied bier crafted in the Leavenworth tradition. This richly amber seasonal owes its smooth, malty flavor to a large percentage of Munich malt. In the classic German tradition, we add both noble Tettnanger and imported Tradition hops for an authentic Oktoberfest hop aroma.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"25","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":81,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,43,50],"updateDate":[2015,12,16,6,11,19],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/pmdkR9/upload_oqEsDm-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/pmdkR9/upload_oqEsDm-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/pmdkR9/upload_oqEsDm-large.png"},"style":{"id":81,"categoryId":7,"name":"German-Style Märzen","shortName":"Märzen","description":"Märzens are characterized by a medium body and broad range of color. They can range from golden to reddish orange. Sweet maltiness should dominate slightly over a clean hop bitterness. Malt character should be light-toasted rather than strongly caramel (though a low level of light caramel character is acceptable). Bread or biscuit-like malt character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Hop aroma and flavor should be low but notable. Ale-like fruity esters should not be perceived. Diacetyl and chill haze should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"18","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"5.3","abvMax":"5.9","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"15","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,36,50],"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
