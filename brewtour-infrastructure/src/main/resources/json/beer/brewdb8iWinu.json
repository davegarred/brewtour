{"breweryId":"CFmMeZ","id":"8iWinu","name":"Dirtyface Amber","description":"Finally, a beer that pays homage to the hard working folks in our Valley; the trail crews and farmers, the lumberjacks and firefighters, we brew this for you. With a thirsty throat in mind, we’ve created an amber lager that features a smooth, medium body, with a rich toasted malt aroma. The initial malty sweetness finishes fresh and clean... unlike its name. No need to wash up, just wash down.","abv":"5","ibu":"21","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":81,"glasswareId":3,"srmId":11,"createDate":[2013,1,23,1,25,33],"updateDate":[2015,12,17,0,20,5],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/8iWinu/upload_3RkfjO-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/8iWinu/upload_3RkfjO-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/8iWinu/upload_3RkfjO-large.png"},"style":{"id":81,"categoryId":7,"name":"German-Style Märzen","shortName":"Märzen","description":"Märzens are characterized by a medium body and broad range of color. They can range from golden to reddish orange. Sweet maltiness should dominate slightly over a clean hop bitterness. Malt character should be light-toasted rather than strongly caramel (though a low level of light caramel character is acceptable). Bread or biscuit-like malt character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Hop aroma and flavor should be low but notable. Ale-like fruity esters should not be perceived. Diacetyl and chill haze should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"18","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"5.3","abvMax":"5.9","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"15","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,36,50],"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":3,"name":"Mug","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]},"srm":{"id":11,"name":"11","hex":"D77200"}}
