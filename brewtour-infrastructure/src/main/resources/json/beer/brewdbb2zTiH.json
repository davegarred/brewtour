{"breweryId":"17tUiZ","id":"b2zTiH","name":"Dark Days Black IPA","description":"We first brewed this beer to kick off the Latona’s Winter Beer Series in 2009. Proprietor Bob Brenlin asked us to make a special beer that he could serve at the Latona, Hopvine, and Fiddler’s Inn, and since it was set to debut on the Winter Solstice, the darkest day of the year, especially here in Seattle, we were only too hoppy to oblige: we squished together the best aspects of Porter and IPA, keeping the dark malt complexity while pairing it with the assertive hop spiciness of Centennials. Black India Pale Ale is oxymoronic, of course, so we like to call this a Cascadian Dark Ale, to reflect the fact that our weather here is generally dark and we like our beers with hops and introspection. O.G. 17 P, 6.5% ABV, 75 IBU.","abv":"6.5","ibu":"75","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":125,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,43,3],"updateDate":[2015,12,16,8,31,37],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/b2zTiH/upload_5xMqXl-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/b2zTiH/upload_5xMqXl-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/b2zTiH/upload_5xMqXl-large.png"},"style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley. Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,44,53],"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
