The grain is smoked over a special blend of fruit woods to give the beer a unique taste not found in other Porters. Enjoy this with a thick New York Strip and you’ll think you’ve died and gone to heaven.","abv":"6","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":18,"createDate":[2013,4,5,19,59],"updateDate":[2015,11,13,20,43,26],"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.
