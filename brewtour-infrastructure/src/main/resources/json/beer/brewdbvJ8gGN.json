{"breweryId":"h9obbv","id":"vJ8gGN","name":"Holmium Hefeweizen","description":"Holmium is a rare earth element that is a relatively soft and malleable silvery-white metal.  It has the highest magnetic strength of any element, and because holmium strongly absorbs neutrons, it is also used in nuclear control rods.  We thought it a fitting name for our newest brew which is a light white Bavarian style Hefeweizen with subtle notes of coriander and orange.  We hope it attracts you like a magnet!","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":48,"createDate":[2015,8,7,22,18,55],"updateDate":[2015,8,7,22,18,55],"style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen / Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-, nutmeg-like, mildly smoke-like or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters should be present at low to medium-high levels. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent or present at very low levels. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,29,27],"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}}}
