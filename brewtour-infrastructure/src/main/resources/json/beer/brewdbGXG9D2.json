{"breweryId":"t559gG","id":"GXG9D2","name":"Stellar Stout","description":"This aleâ€™s attributes can first be seen in the beautiful opaque, black color and creamy tan head. A gentle swirl of this ale reveals to the nose a subtle fruitiness layered with cocoa and roasted aromas. The flavor is slightly sweet balanced perfectly by its midrange alcohol level and overall drinkability, making this stout truly stellar!","abv":"5","ibu":"25","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":42,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2013,4,30,23,26,18],"updateDate":[2015,4,14,15,7,23],"style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish. Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas are prominent. Some slight roasted malt acidity is permissible and a medium- to full-bodied mouthfeel is appropriate. Hop bitterness may be moderate to high. Hop aroma and flavor is moderate to high, often with American citrus-type and/or resiny hop character. The perception of fruity esters is low.
