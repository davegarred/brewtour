{"breweryId":"17tUiZ","id":"kb4Yt1","name":"Old Wooly Barleywine","description":"Anticipated throughout the fall and released on December 1st each year, Old Wooly is Big Time's biggest and rarest beer. It is always powerfully malty with a prodigious amount of hops for balance. In addition to Northwestern 2-row pale malt, English Crystal, Munich, Carastan malts are used along with just a touch of roasted barley for a slight dryness and additional color. Old Wooly is bittered with Yakima Nugget hops and finished with Cascade and Centennial. Only 7 barrels of Old Wooly are brewed each year in late June. The beer is aged in our cellar until the 1st of December and then put on tap at the pub until it's gone. Starting gravity from 22-24 Plato and alcohol 8.5 to 9.5 by weight.\r\nAlso available in a limited number of 22 oz. bottles to go.","abv":"9","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":34,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,43,52],"updateDate":[2015,12,16,8,43,45],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/kb4Yt1/upload_6vam0k-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/kb4Yt1/upload_6vam0k-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/kb4Yt1/upload_6vam0k-large.png"},"style":{"id":34,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"American Barleywine","description":"American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness. Complexity of alcohols and fruity-ester characters are often high and counterbalanced by assertive bitterness and extraordinary alcohol content. Hop aroma and flavor are at medium to very high levels. American type hops are often used but not necessary for this style. Very low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. A caramel and/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"60","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"8.4","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"11","srmMax":"22","ogMin":"1.09","fgMin":"1.024","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,27,8],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
