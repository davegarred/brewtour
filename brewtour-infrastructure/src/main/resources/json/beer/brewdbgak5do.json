{"breweryId":"vR4nXO","id":"gak5do","name":"Sumatra Coffee Stout","description":"Our stout, designed in collaboration with Phil Beattie of Dillanos Coffee Roasters, has a rich coffee aroma and smooth mocha finish.  Flaked oats and premium malts and hops create a medium-bodied beer which is flavored with cold-brewed Sumatran coffee. The result is a deeply-colored beverage which is richly satisfying and easy to enjoy.","abv":"6.5","ibu":"18","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":20,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,44,19],"updateDate":[2012,3,22,13,5,15],"style":{"id":20,"categoryId":1,"name":"Sweet or Cream Stout","shortName":"Sweet Stout","description":"Sweet stouts, also referred to as cream stouts, have less roasted bitter flavor and a full-bodied mouthfeel. The style can be given more body with milk sugar (lactose) before bottling. Malt sweetness, chocolate, and caramel flavor should dominate the flavor profile and contribute to the aroma. Hops should balance and suppress some of the sweetness without contributing apparent flavor or aroma. The overall impression should be sweet and full-bodied.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"3","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.045","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,24,41],"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
