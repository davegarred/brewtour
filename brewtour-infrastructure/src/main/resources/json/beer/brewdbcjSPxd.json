The unique combination of yeast and lactic acid bacteria fermentation yields a beer that is acidic, highly attenuated, and very light bodied. The carbonation of a Berliner Weisse is high, and hop rates are very low. Clarity may be hazy or cloudy from yeast or chill haze. Hop character should not be perceived. Fruity esters will be evident. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"3","ibuMax":"6","abvMin":"2.8","abvMax":"3.4","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.028","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.006","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,29,14],"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"glass":{"id":9,"name":"Weizen","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
