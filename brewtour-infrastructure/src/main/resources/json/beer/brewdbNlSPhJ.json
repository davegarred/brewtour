{"breweryId":"h9obbv","id":"NlSPhJ","name":"B-17 Brown Ale","description":"The words “mild” and “brown” are two of the oldest terms used to describe English beers.  Brown ales used brown malts which were kilned over a hardwood fire and originally had a smoky flavor.  Brown ales became the overall term used to distinguished the darker stouts and porters from beers made with pale malts.  Often, a stout and then a porter was drawn from the same mash of brown malts.  Our B-17 Brown Ale uses seven different grains and three different hops to give it a complex malt profile and body with medium hops.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":37,"createDate":[2015,8,7,21,22,32],"updateDate":[2015,8,7,21,22,32],"style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color. Roasted malt caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be of medium intensity in both flavor and aroma. American brown ales have evident low to medium hop flavor and aroma, medium to high hop bitterness, and a medium body. Estery and fruity-ester characters should be subdued. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"6.4","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"26","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,27,35],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}}}
