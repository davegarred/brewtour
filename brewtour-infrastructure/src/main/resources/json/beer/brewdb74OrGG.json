{"breweryId":"NfJcL9","id":"74OrGG","name":"Irish Eyes Stought","description":"\"When Irish Eyes Are Smiling…\" as the ol' tune goes, and now you know why. Dark in colour but light in body. It all starts with husky barley grains, some of which get toasted and roasted, then boiled up with some earthy hops, then fed to the yeasties who give us alcohol in return, then pumped full o’ nitro for a creamy and silky mouthfeel. Faintly woodsy, smoky, minty. Ah yes, \"…let us smile each chance we get.\"","abv":"4","ibu":"40","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":23,"createDate":[2015,3,13,18,54,43],"updateDate":[2015,3,13,18,54,43],"style":{"id":23,"categoryId":2,"name":"Classic Irish-Style Dry Stout","shortName":"Dry Irish Stout","description":"Dry stouts have an initial malt and light caramel flavor profile with a distinctive dry-roasted bitterness in the finish. Dry stouts achieve a dry-roasted character through the use of roasted barley. The emphasis of coffee-like roasted barley and a moderate degree of roasted malt aromas define much of the character. Some slight acidity may be perceived but is not necessary. European hop aroma and flavor should be low or not perceived. Dry stouts have medium-light to medium body. Fruity esters are minimal and overshadowed by malt, high hop bitterness, and roasted barley character. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be very low or not perceived. Head retention and rich character should be part of its visual character.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,23,51],"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}}}
