{"breweryId":"17tUiZ","id":"NjMsDG","name":"Tinderstick ESB","description":"A more traditionally English interpretation of the style than its Big Time cousins, brewed with Maris Otter pale and crystal malts for a rich, round malt flavor accentuated by a touch of dark malt complexity, and balanced by the herbal, grassy and earthy hop character from the late kettle additions of Fuggles and Kent Goldings. A beautiful and satisfying session beer.  25 IBUs, 4.25% ABV","abv":"4.25","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":3,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,44,23],"updateDate":[2015,5,14,3,41,2],"style":{"id":3,"categoryId":1,"name":"Ordinary Bitter","shortName":"Bitter","description":"Ordinary bitter is gold to copper colored with medium bitterness, light to medium body, and low to medium residual malt sweetness. Hop flavor and aroma character may be evident at the brewer's discretion. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character and very low diacetyl (butterscotch) character are acceptable in aroma and flavor, but should be minimized in this form of bitter. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3","abvMax":"4.1","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"12","ogMin":"1.033","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,18,39],"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
