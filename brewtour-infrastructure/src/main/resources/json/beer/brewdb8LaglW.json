{"breweryId":"2BFwoJ","id":"8LaglW","name":"Hale's Wheat Wine","description":"This is a smooth, vibrant beer with an emphasis on the lightness in flavor of the wheat, with the alcohol strength of \"winter beers.\"  Wheat wine is a beer with an increased percentage of wheat to barley ratio (40% here).  This has the perception of lightening the beer in appearance and flavor, and achieving an alcohol content on par with barleywine.","abv":"10","isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":35,"createDate":[2015,6,12,15,59,37],"updateDate":[2015,6,12,15,59,37],"style":{"id":35,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Wheat Wine Ale","shortName":"Wheatwine","description":"American style wheat wines range from gold to deep amber and are brewed with 50% or more wheat malt. They have full body and high residual malty sweetness. Perception of bitterness is moderate to medium -high. Fruity-ester characters are often high and counterbalanced by complexity of alcohols and high alcohol content. Hop aroma and flavor are at low to medium levels. Very low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. Bready, wheat, honey-like and/or caramel aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Phenolic yeast character, sulfur, and/or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be present. Oxidized, stale and aged characters are not typical of this style. Chill haze is allowable.","ibuMin":"45","ibuMax":"85","abvMin":"8.4","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"8","srmMax":"15","ogMin":"1.088","fgMin":"1.024","fgMax":"1.032","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,27,17],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}}}
