{"breweryId":"Wsssvf","id":"Znvl4I","name":"Midnight CDA","description":"Midnight CDA is Kulshanâ€™s interpretation of the Cascadian Dark Ale or Black IPA style. Brewed with a portion of dark malts, including Midnight Wheat Malt, our CDA is a deep reddish-brown in color with a touch of roast nosing through the floral hop aroma. The flavor is balanced between the citrusy hops and rich, toasty malt with just a hint of roast. It finishes dry and crisp.","abv":"7","ibu":"62","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"With its balance of sharp hoppiness, rich caramel and slight roastiness, Midnight CDA pairs well with grilled meats of all types. Try it with a smoked sausage or anything containing bacon. In fact, if you are looking for the perfect breakfast beer pairing, try Midnight CDA with buckwheat pancakes, real maple syrup and smoky bacon. From the cheese aisle, try a pungent soft-rind cheese or smoked cheddar or Gouda.","availableId":1,"styleId":41,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,5,30,1,37,53],"updateDate":[2015,7,10,17,31,54],"style":{"id":41,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Black Ale","shortName":"Black Ale","description":"American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body.
