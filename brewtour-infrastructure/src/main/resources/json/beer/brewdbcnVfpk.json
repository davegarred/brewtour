{"breweryId":"YLlyzA","id":"cnVfpk","name":"Columbia Kölsch","description":"This is a smooth, soft-bodied, golden ale that is lightly fruity with a pleasing dry finish. It is styled after the Kölsch beers of Germany. The yeast culture is a hybrid between a lager and an ale. Extended cold conditioning is used to develop the dry finish characteristic of lager beers, and yet retains the fruitiness found in ales. The lower alcohol content makes this a very refreshing, thirst-quenching ale. The Columbia Kölsch is our best-selling draft beer.","abv":"4.4","ibu":"21","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":45,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2013,5,17,23,53,29],"updateDate":[2013,5,23,23,48,54],"style":{"id":45,"categoryId":4,"name":"German-Style Kölsch / Köln-Style Kölsch","shortName":"Kölsch","description":"Kölsch is warm fermented and aged at cold temperatures (German ale or alt-style beer). Kölsch is characterized by a golden to straw color and a slightly dry, subtly sweet softness on the palate, yet crisp. Good, dense head retention is desirable. Light pearapple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Caramel character should not be evident. The body is light to medium-light. This beer has low hop flavor and aroma with medium bitterness. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all. Chill haze should be absent.","ibuMin":"18","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.3","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"6","ogMin":"1.042","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,29,4],"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
