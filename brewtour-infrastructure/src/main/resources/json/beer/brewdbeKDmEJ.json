{"breweryId":"IaQrxj","id":"eKDmEJ","name":"Waldman","description":"Waldman is modeled after an English Ordinary Bitter with a few decidedly Belgian stylings. It is brewed with Northern Brewer hops and 36 lbs of Belgian Candi Sugar then fermented with a Belgian Ale yeast. We finish with Brettanomyces \"Wild\" Yeast Strain and a heavy dose of dry hops. The Brett is carried over to the bottles where Waldman continues to develop complex flavors throughout bottle conditioning.","abv":"8.3","ibu":"30","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":5,"styleId":3,"glasswareId":6,"createDate":[2012,9,8,12,1],"updateDate":[2015,4,24,14,59,21],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/eKDmEJ/upload_C1utTn-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/eKDmEJ/upload_C1utTn-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/eKDmEJ/upload_C1utTn-large.png"},"style":{"id":3,"categoryId":1,"name":"Ordinary Bitter","shortName":"Bitter","description":"Ordinary bitter is gold to copper colored with medium bitterness, light to medium body, and low to medium residual malt sweetness. Hop flavor and aroma character may be evident at the brewer's discretion. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character and very low diacetyl (butterscotch) character are acceptable in aroma and flavor, but should be minimized in this form of bitter. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3","abvMax":"4.1","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"12","ogMin":"1.033","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,18,39],"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":5,"name":"Spring","description":"Available during the spring months."},"glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
