{"breweryId":"iWV3FQ","id":"OlWDZv","name":"Serengeti Wheat","description":"A crisp, refreshing American style Hefeweizen that is brewed with the best ingredients the Northwest has to offer. We use 50% locally sourced two-row pale malt and 50% locally grown northwest malted wheat well above the required 30% wheat additions to be called a wheat beer. This Northwest style Hefeweizen is unfiltered for a \"cloudy\" appearance and brewed with plenty of Yakima valley hops yielding a wonderful citrus finish, delicious with or without a lemon garnish.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":35,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2013,4,28,17,0,30],"updateDate":[2015,12,17,2,38,12],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/OlWDZv/upload_zpLwUM-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/OlWDZv/upload_zpLwUM-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/OlWDZv/upload_zpLwUM-large.png"},"style":{"id":35,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Wheat Wine Ale","shortName":"Wheatwine","description":"American style wheat wines range from gold to deep amber and are brewed with 50% or more wheat malt. They have full body and high residual malty sweetness. Perception of bitterness is moderate to medium -high. Fruity-ester characters are often high and counterbalanced by complexity of alcohols and high alcohol content. Hop aroma and flavor are at low to medium levels. Very low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. Bready, wheat, honey-like and/or caramel aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Phenolic yeast character, sulfur, and/or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be present. Oxidized, stale and aged characters are not typical of this style. Chill haze is allowable.","ibuMin":"45","ibuMax":"85","abvMin":"8.4","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"8","srmMax":"15","ogMin":"1.088","fgMin":"1.024","fgMax":"1.032","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,27,17],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
