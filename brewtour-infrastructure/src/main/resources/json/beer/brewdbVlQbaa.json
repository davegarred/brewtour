Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas are prominent. Some slight acidity is permissible and a medium- to full-bodied mouthfeel is appropriate. Bitterness may be high but the perception is often compromised by malt sweetness. Hop aroma and flavor should not be perceived. The perception of fruity esters is low. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be negligible or not perceived. Head retention is excellent.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"60","abvMin":"5.7","abvMax":"9.3","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.052","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,23,58],"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"srm":{"id":40,"name":"40","hex":"36080A"}}
