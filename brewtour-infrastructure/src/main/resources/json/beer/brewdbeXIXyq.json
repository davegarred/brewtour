{"breweryId":"h9obbv","id":"eXIXyq","name":"Einstein’s Depleted Blonde Ale","description":"Not wanting to waste the potential to make perfectly good beer, the weaker, or depleted wort was boiled with domestic Northern Brewer kettle hops and imported German Hallertauer finishing hops, then fermented to yield a lighter-bodied, refreshing, blonde-colored ale.  For those of you familiar with the beers at Atomic – Einstein’s Depleted Blonde Ale is similar in strength and taste to our Burks’ Blonde.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":36,"createDate":[2015,8,7,22,1,53],"updateDate":[2015,8,7,22,1,53],"style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.
