{"breweryId":"IaQrxj","id":"Fq57Uh","name":"Baby Reida","description":"Georgetown brewers decided to divert Lovely Reida sparged wort once it reached a certain concentration to the 15bbl system for a whole new beer and try their hand at an English Style Bitter. The result is a sweet and malty beer with a floral, herbal hop flavor. The bitterness comes through strong like an IPA without the citrus character.","abv":"5","ibu":"50","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":3,"createDate":[2013,5,3,21,19,5],"updateDate":[2015,4,28,13,31,29],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Fq57Uh/upload_c4EoL9-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Fq57Uh/upload_c4EoL9-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Fq57Uh/upload_c4EoL9-large.png"},"style":{"id":3,"categoryId":1,"name":"Ordinary Bitter","shortName":"Bitter","description":"Ordinary bitter is gold to copper colored with medium bitterness, light to medium body, and low to medium residual malt sweetness. Hop flavor and aroma character may be evident at the brewer's discretion. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character and very low diacetyl (butterscotch) character are acceptable in aroma and flavor, but should be minimized in this form of bitter. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3","abvMax":"4.1","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"12","ogMin":"1.033","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,18,39],"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."}}
