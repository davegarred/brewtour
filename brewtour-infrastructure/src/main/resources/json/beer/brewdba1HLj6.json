{"breweryId":"IaQrxj","id":"a1HLj6","name":"Ol'Hara Holiday Stout","description":"A Holiday Stout brewed for our damp winter days. Six different malts give this beer complexity: rich roasted caramel and dark chocolate flavors with subtle coffee undertones. Oats provide a velvety texture that plays well with the dry and slightly bitter finish, and a whisper of spice will have you dreaming of being snowed in.","abv":"7.2","ibu":"35","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":7,"styleId":42,"createDate":[2013,3,25,21,58,15],"updateDate":[2013,3,26,12,16,39],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/a1HLj6/upload_Ri5tVu-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/a1HLj6/upload_Ri5tVu-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/a1HLj6/upload_Ri5tVu-large.png"},"style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish. Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas are prominent. Some slight roasted malt acidity is permissible and a medium- to full-bodied mouthfeel is appropriate. Hop bitterness may be moderate to high. Hop aroma and flavor is moderate to high, often with American citrus-type and/or resiny hop character. The perception of fruity esters is low. Roasted malt/barley astringency may be low but not excessive. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be negligible or not perceived. Head retention is excellent.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"60","abvMin":"5.7","abvMax":"8.8","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,28,43],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":7,"name":"Fall","description":"Available during the fall months."}}
