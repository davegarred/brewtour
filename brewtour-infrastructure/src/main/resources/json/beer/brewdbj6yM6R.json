{"breweryId":"IaQrxj","id":"j6yM6R","name":"Lagereida","description":"Somewhere between a North German Pils and a Dortmund Lager, Lagereida is a clean lager beer with biscuity maltiness, a peppery hop nose and subtle skunky character. A sort of \"parti-gyle\" brew, the recipe was developed on the fly when there were 15 barrels worth of second runnings from a Lovely Reida batch that had nowhere to go.","abv":"5.1","ibu":"28","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":93,"createDate":[2013,5,3,21,19,43],"updateDate":[2015,12,17,2,11,11],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/j6yM6R/upload_R0Hzfh-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/j6yM6R/upload_R0Hzfh-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/j6yM6R/upload_R0Hzfh-large.png"},"style":{"id":93,"categoryId":8,"name":"American-Style Lager","shortName":"American Lager","description":"Light in body and very light to straw in color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated. Flavor components should b e subtle and complex, with no one ingredient dominating the others. Malt sweetness is light to mild. Corn, rice, or other grain or sugar adjuncts are often used. Hop bitterness, flavor and aroma are negligible to very light. Light fruity esters are acceptable. Chill haze and diacetyl should be absent.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"13","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,39,26],"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}}}
