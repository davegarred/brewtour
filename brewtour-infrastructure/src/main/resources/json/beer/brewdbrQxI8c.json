These ales are hopped predominantly with fresh (newly harvested and kilned) and/or undried (“wet”) hops. These beers will exhibit especially aromas and flavors of green, almost chlorophyll-like or other fresh hop characters, in harmony with the characters of the base style of the beer. These beers may be aged and enjoyed after the initial “fresh-hop” character diminishes. Unique character from “aged” fresh hop beers may emerge, but they have yet to be defined.","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,25,25],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
