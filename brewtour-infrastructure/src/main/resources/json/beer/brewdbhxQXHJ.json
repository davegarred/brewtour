They are light to medium in body. This style of beer is characterized by a toasted malt aroma, slight malt sweetness in flavor, and low to medium hop bitterness. Noble-type hop aromas and flavors should be low to medium. Fruity esters can be light to medium in intensity. Flavor of alcohol is evident. Earthy, cellarlike, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived but chill haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character. French-Style Biére de Garde may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"30","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8","srmMin":"8","srmMax":"16","ogMin":"1.06","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.024","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,34,8],"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
