{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"LcsDYp","name":"Red Alt","description":"This red is an alt, a close cousin to the kolsch style.  Alts originated in Dusseldorf, while the kolsch style originated in cologne, but both are made by fermenting at lager temperatures using an ale yeast.  The result is a smooth-drinking, clean beer (lager), with lots of fruity essences from the yeast (ale), truly a hybrid style.  Red alt is a nice example of the style.  It has a pretty red hue and is clean and very drinkable. The bready base supports an aroma that has a bouquet of fruity notes (some might say: “juicy fruit!”), that give this beer its defining characteristic.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":55,"glasswareId":7,"createDate":[2012,4,15,18,25,47],"updateDate":[2012,4,15,18,25,47],"style":{"id":55,"categoryId":4,"name":"German-Style Altbier","shortName":"Altbier","description":"German-Style Altbiers are copper to dark brown ales, originally from the Düsseldorf area.
