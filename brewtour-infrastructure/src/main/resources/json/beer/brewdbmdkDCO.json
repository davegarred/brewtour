Light to medium body and low malt aroma are typical. They are light amber to deep amber in color. Noble-type hops are commonly used. Low to medium fruity esters are evident in aroma and flavor. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may be perceived. Low caramel or toasted malt flavor is okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"30","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"12","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,32,6],"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
