{"breweryId":"Wsssvf","id":"cEe7i4","name":"Kulshan Brewing Company","description":"An export-style stout brewed with beechwood smoked malt, creating a dynamic smoked stout. Allow yourself to be transported back to the days when all beer had a smoky character due to the malting process of barley and the fuels of the age. Rich, sharp, clean and an earthy smoky character complete this beer. So enjoy it fireside, amongst the trees as snow falls, or best of all with a meal prepared over wood stoked flames.","abv":"7.2","ibu":"42","isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":42,"createDate":[2015,7,29,14,47,17],"updateDate":[2015,7,29,14,47,18],"style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish. Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas are prominent. Some slight roasted malt acidity is permissible and a medium- to full-bodied mouthfeel is appropriate. Hop bitterness may be moderate to high. Hop aroma and flavor is moderate to high, often with American citrus-type and/or resiny hop character. The perception of fruity esters is low. Roasted malt/barley astringency may be low but not excessive. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be negligible or not perceived. Head retention is excellent.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"60","abvMin":"5.7","abvMax":"8.8","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,28,43],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}}}
