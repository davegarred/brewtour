{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"Ca2e18","name":"Ingalls Ginger","description":"Ingalls ginger is a ginger ale, but not one for the kids.   Ingalls features ginger flavor and aroma on top of a backbone that is best described as a pale.  The just-above-subtle ginger flavor is backed by a light hop bitterness (with the ginger contributing a little as well), with some residual sweetness and mouth feel from the large portion of wheat used in the grain bill.  A late portion of cascade hops complement the ginger aroma with a nice citrus counterpart.   A great refreshing beer that will surely be a hit for the ginger lovers and even for (most of the) ginger doubters (we had a few taste the beer throughout the process).","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":124,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,4,15,18,27,58],"updateDate":[2014,10,20,19,16,25],"style":{"id":124,"categoryId":11,"name":"Herb and Spice Beer","shortName":"Spice Beer","description":"Herb beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and/or spices used may not always be identifiable. Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,44,45],"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
