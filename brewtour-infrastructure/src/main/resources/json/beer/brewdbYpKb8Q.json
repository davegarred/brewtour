{"breweryId":"N7gSdA","id":"YpKb8Q","name":"Summer Beer","description":"This beer is crisp, clean, refreshing, and hoppy. Summer Beer is a pre-Prohibition Pilsner fermented with our ale yeast to impart more character to the beer compared to lager yeast. A small amount of flaked maize and losts of Czech Saaz hops give this beer a spicy herbal aroma and a dry finish. Great with meals or by itself during our warm summer months.","abv":"5.6","ibu":"32","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":98,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,11,3,16,42,20],"updateDate":[2015,12,16,19,36,21],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/YpKb8Q/upload_YS38pq-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/YpKb8Q/upload_YS38pq-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/YpKb8Q/upload_YS38pq-large.png"},"style":{"id":98,"categoryId":8,"name":"American-Style Pilsener","shortName":"American Pilsener","description":"This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color.
