{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"cOiLqM","name":"Snowfield Winter 2011","description":"This is our second season of the Snowfield. We made this year’s version based on previous batches, but changing things up to hit a new season.  This winter, we pulled back on the crystal malts (don’t worry there’s still plenty in there!) to make the beer slightly less sweet.  We increased the hopping rates slightly but still used 100% centennial (flavor and aroma).  This produced a slightly more bitter and hop forward beer that is nicely balanced by the chocolaty, sweet malt backbone and higher alcohol %.  A big, silky mouthfeel, perfect for something that would be considered a “winter warmer”.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":124,"glasswareId":6,"createDate":[2012,4,15,18,39,33],"updateDate":[2015,6,5,14,28,22],"style":{"id":124,"categoryId":11,"name":"Herb and Spice Beer","shortName":"Spice Beer","description":"Herb beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and/or spices used may not always be identifiable. Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,44,45],"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
