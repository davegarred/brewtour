{"breweryId":"IaQrxj","id":"bLpgVK","name":"Georgetown Porter","description":"Brewed for our friends at the 9 Pound Hammer here in Georgetown, this is an exceptionally flavorful medium bodied porter. We use tons of Chocolate, Munich, and Roasted Malt, then blend it with Centennial and Northern Brewer hops to create what we'd like to call Roasted Chocolaty Goodness. Mmm.. porter. Buy it by the pint at the Nine Pound Hammer or come on in to our retail shop for growlers to go!","abv":"6.2","ibu":"40","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":18,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,43,16],"updateDate":[2012,9,8,11,49,24],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/bLpgVK/upload_yVWnrd-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/bLpgVK/upload_yVWnrd-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/bLpgVK/upload_yVWnrd-large.png"},"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.
