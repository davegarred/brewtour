{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"aGJprh","name":"Eldorado Pale Ale","description":"In this part of the country, pale ales and IPAs donâ€™t need any introduction.  There are so many examples of the style, which run the gamut from being nicely balanced to overly hop forward.  We tried to make a pale ale with a light malt backbone and nice bitterness that would support and balance an unmistakably emphasized hop aroma and flavor.  We used several varieties of hops so that none would dominate and would blend together to give a nice citrusy and floral aroma.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":25,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,4,15,18,26,51],"updateDate":[2012,4,15,18,35,18],"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color. The style is characterized by fruity, floral and citrus-like American-variety hop character producing medium to medium-high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Note that the \"traditional\" style of this beer has its origins with certain floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American hop varietals. One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"42","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.6","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,25,18],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
