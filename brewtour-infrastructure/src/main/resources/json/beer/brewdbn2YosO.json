{"breweryId":"17tUiZ","id":"n2YosO","name":"Buck Mulligan's Dublin Stout","description":"A smooth, eminently drinkable stout on the order of Guinness draft, served on nitrogen to provide a solid and creamy head. The Buck is both stately and plump, a condition achieved through the combination of a partial sour mash, a deep roasted barley backbone, and the velvety texture of flaked barley.","abv":"4","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":24,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,55],"updateDate":[2015,10,27,18,31,23],"style":{"id":24,"categoryId":2,"name":"Foreign (Export)-Style Stout","shortName":"Export Stout","description":"As with classic dry stouts, foreign-style stouts have an initial malt sweetness and caramel flavor with a distinctive dry-roasted bitterness in the finish. Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas are prominent. Some slight acidity is permissible and a medium- to full-bodied mouthfeel is appropriate. Bitterness may be high but the perception is often compromised by malt sweetness. Hop aroma and flavor should not be perceived. The perception of fruity esters is low. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be negligible or not perceived. Head retention is excellent.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"60","abvMin":"5.7","abvMax":"9.3","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.052","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,23,58],"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
