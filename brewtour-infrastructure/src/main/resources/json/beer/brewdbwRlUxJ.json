No roast barley or strong burnt/astringent black malt character should be perceived. Medium malt, caramel and cocoa-like sweetness. Hop bitterness is perceived at a medium-low to medium level. Hop flavor and aroma may vary from being low to medium-high. This is a full bodied beer. Ale-like fruity esters should be evident but not overpowering and compliment hop character and malt derived sweetness. Diacetyl (butterscotch) levels should be absent.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"5.5","abvMax":"9.5","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.08","ogMax":"1.1","fgMin":"1.02","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":[2013,8,10,12,42,51],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,49,32],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}}}
