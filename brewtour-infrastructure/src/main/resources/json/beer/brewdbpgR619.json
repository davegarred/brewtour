{"breweryId":"17tUiZ","id":"pgR619","name":"Action Jackson","description":"It has become a Big Time tradition to honor our friends and family, that is, our coworkers and regular customers, when they enter a period of transition, by creating a beer specifically with them in mind. The newest incarnation in this series celebrates Nathaniel Jackson, longtime owner of the Allegro Café, which has been a University District hangout for more than thirty years. As unofficial Mayor of the U-District and an International Man of Leisure, Nathaniel’s wisdom and insight, along with his keen keg washing chops, have earned him a permanent place at our bar. Check out his beer, which has the Bhagwan ascending the mountaintop seeking enlightenment, and returning to the base saying, “Where’s management?” Bold adventure has always been his game, and this beer shouldn’t disappoint: lots of Chinook, Cascade, and Centennial, and a secret ingredient in the mash. O.G. 16.7, 6.1% ABV, 75 IBU.","abv":"6.1","ibu":"75","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":30,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,38],"updateDate":[2014,10,13,19,58,23],"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
