{"breweryId":"g5GKTi","id":"utftMS","name":"Baron Schwarzbier","description":"The Baron Schwarzbier is a classic German black lager, deep black with ruby and brown highlights. At first the Schwarzbier starts with a slight roasty nose and taste, followed by a faint chocolate-malty body with a very crisp, clean, lagered finish. Lagered for an average of 10-12 weeks to provide a very smooth, easy drinking Schwarzbier with full flavor provided by the dark malts. \n\nAll ingredients for the beer are imported from Germany. Brewed in accordance to the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot) of 1516.","abv":"4.9","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":84,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,45],"updateDate":[2012,3,22,13,5,5],"style":{"id":84,"categoryId":7,"name":"German-Style Schwarzbier","shortName":"Schwarzbier","description":"These very dark brown to black beers have a mild roasted malt character without the associated bitterness. This is not a fullbodied beer, but rather a moderate body gently enhances malt flavor and aroma with low to moderate levels of sweetness. Hop bitterness is low to medium in character. Noble-type hop flavor and aroma should be low but perceptible. There should be no fruity esters. Diacetyl should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"22","ibuMax":"30","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"25","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,37,12],"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}}}
