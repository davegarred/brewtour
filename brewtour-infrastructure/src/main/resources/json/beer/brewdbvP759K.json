A roasted malt character which is caramel-like and chocolate-like should be evident - smooth and not bitter. Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas (chocolate and nut-like) are prominent. Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels. Original gravity range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"20","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,22,53],"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}}}
