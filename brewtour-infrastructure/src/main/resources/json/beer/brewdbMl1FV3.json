{"breweryId":"5K9U34","id":"Ml1FV3","name":"10 Squared","description":"The Mighty Fish Brewers first produced Ten Squared Anniversary Ale to celebrate Fish Brewing Company's tenth anniversary. The ale was so good and the response to it so overwhelmingly positive that it has become the crown jewel of REEL ALEs.\r\n\r\nTen different hops: Horizon, Chinook, Columbus, Willamette, Tradition, Northern Brewer, Santiam, Tettnanger, Cascade and Golding, in the order of their use -- give Ten Squared a unique hop character which has to be tasted to be believed.\r\n\r\nEven with 100 IBUs, this brew sports a strong malt backbone. Two-row Pale, Caramel 40, Caramel 75, Special B and Aromatic malts impart remarkable balance for such a hop monster. This is smooth ale with surprising similarities to ten year old malt whiskey.","abv":"10","ibu":"100","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":34,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,36],"updateDate":[2015,12,15,23,35,33],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Ml1FV3/upload_FAbrWH-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Ml1FV3/upload_FAbrWH-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Ml1FV3/upload_FAbrWH-large.png"},"style":{"id":34,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"American Barleywine","description":"American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness. Complexity of alcohols and fruity-ester characters are often high and counterbalanced by assertive bitterness and extraordinary alcohol content. Hop aroma and flavor are at medium to very high levels. American type hops are often used but not necessary for this style. Very low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. A caramel and/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"60","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"8.4","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"11","srmMax":"22","ogMin":"1.09","fgMin":"1.024","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,27,8],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
