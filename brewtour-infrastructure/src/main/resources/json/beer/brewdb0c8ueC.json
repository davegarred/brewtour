It is a light, crisp, golden ale and is a good choice for those whose palates are accustomed to America's light lagers. Hopped exclusively with the Sterling and Tettnanger hops, Cascade Head is a refreshing option for those who prefer their ales a little less aggressive.","abv":"4.52","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":36,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,10,4,18,2,27],"updateDate":[2012,10,4,18,3,14],"style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.
