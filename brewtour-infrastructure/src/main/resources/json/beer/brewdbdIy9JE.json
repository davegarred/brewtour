Flavor components should b e subtle and complex, with no one ingredient dominating the others. Malt sweetness is light to mild. Corn, rice, or other grain or sugar adjuncts are often used. Hop bitterness, flavor and aroma are negligible to very light. Light fruity esters are acceptable. Chill haze and diacetyl should be absent.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"13","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,39,26],"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}}}
