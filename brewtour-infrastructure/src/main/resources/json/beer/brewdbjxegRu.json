{"breweryId":"Wsssvf","id":"jxegRu","name":"Shuksan Russian Imperial Stout - Barrel Aged","description":"Like the reverb of an amp, barrels add a dynamic to beer that builds upon layers of flavor. We chose American Single Malt Whiskey Barrels from Westland Distillery to be our amplifier. This beer is a blend of three batches of our Shuksan Russian Imperial Stout: one aged 10 months in barrels, and two batches made with different yeast strains. Together we have created a beer that is robust, smooth, and elegant. The sharp tones of whiskey and oak cut through the sweet chocolate and coffee notes to produce a complex richness able to turn any evening up to eleven.","abv":"9.5","isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":43,"createDate":[2015,7,29,15,11,7],"updateDate":[2015,7,29,15,11,7],"style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content. Generally characterized as very robust. The extremely rich malty flavor and aroma are balanced with assertive hopping and fruity-ester characteristics. Bitterness should be moderately high to very high and balanced with full sweet malt character. Roasted malt astringency and bitterness can be moderately perceived but should not overwhelm the overall character. Hop aroma is usually moderately-high to overwhelmingly hop-floral, -citrus or -herbal. Diacetyl (butterscotch) levels should be absent.","ibuMin":"50","ibuMax":"80","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.08","fgMin":"1.02","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,28,49],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}}}
