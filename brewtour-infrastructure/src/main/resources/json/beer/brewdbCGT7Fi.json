The style can be given more body with milk sugar (lactose) before bottling. Malt sweetness, chocolate, and caramel flavor should dominate the flavor profile and contribute to the aroma. Hops should balance and suppress some of the sweetness without contributing apparent flavor or aroma. The overall impression should be sweet and full-bodied.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"3","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.045","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,24,41],"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}}}
