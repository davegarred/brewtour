{"breweryId":"DgW4AB","id":"atu6m1","name":"Dark Mild","description":"A traditional English Dark Mild, one of the great underappreciated beers. Mild in ABV, mild in hop bitterness and aroma, yet our most full flavoured and drinkable ale. Light bodied and very smooth, yet dark in colour with a rich, chocolate flavor.","abv":"3.7","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":11,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2013,7,27,15,1,25],"updateDate":[2015,12,17,4,58,22],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/atu6m1/upload_IjftZv-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/atu6m1/upload_IjftZv-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/atu6m1/upload_IjftZv-large.png"},"style":{"id":11,"categoryId":1,"name":"English-Style Dark Mild Ale","shortName":"English Dark Mild","description":"English dark mild ales range from deep copper to dark brown (often with a red tint) in color.
