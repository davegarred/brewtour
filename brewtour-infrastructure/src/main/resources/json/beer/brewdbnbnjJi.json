We got our hands on some of this new hop and engineered an ale with a simple, light and refreshing body that highlights the lemondropâ€™s interesting qualities.  As its name implies, lemondrop imparts a pleasant aroma that is surely sui generis.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"20","isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":100,"srmId":3,"createDate":[2015,7,28,19,32,43],"updateDate":[2015,7,28,19,32,44],"style":{"id":100,"categoryId":8,"name":"American-Style Malt Liquor","shortName":"Malt Liquor","description":"High in starting gravity and alcoholic strength, this style is somewhat diverse. Some American malt liquors are just slightly stronger than American lagers, while others approach bock strength. Some residual sweetness is perceived. Hop rates are very low, contributing little bitterness and virtually no hop aroma or flavor. Perception of sweet-fruity esters and complex alcohols (though not solvent-like) are acceptable at low levels. Chill haze and diacetyl should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"12","ibuMax":"23","abvMin":"6.25","abvMax":"7.5","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"5","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,41,16],"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"srm":{"id":3,"name":"3","hex":"FFCA5A"}}
