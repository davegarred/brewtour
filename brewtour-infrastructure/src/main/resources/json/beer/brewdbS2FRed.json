{"breweryId":"h9obbv","id":"S2FRed","name":"General Groves IPA","description":"Lieutenant General Leslie Richard Groves, Jr. was a United States Army Corps of Engineers officer who oversaw the construction of the Pentagon and directed the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb during World War II.  He was involved in most aspects of the atomic bomb development. He participated in the selection of sites for research and production at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Los Alamos, New Mexico and Hanford, Washington. Groves had a reputation as a strong and bitter leader, so we found it appropriate to name our IPA after this great man.\r\n\r\nGeneral Groves is a big American IPA; bold, assertive, and full of flavor highlighting the complex citrus and herbal character of our Northwest hops.  The brewer of this IPA takes hops pretty seriously, which is why he added more hops to this IPA than any other IPAs we have produced. He spent a lot of time tinkering, tasting, and tweaking this recipe to get the biggest and best hop flavors and aromas into this beer. His diligence has paid off. His obsession with huge hop flavor led to this beautiful hoppy beverage.","abv":"7","ibu":"72","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":30,"createDate":[2015,8,7,22,9,24],"updateDate":[2015,8,7,22,9,24],"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
