{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"5fbaS6","name":"Early Morning Stout","description":"Early Morning Stout was brewed with the “American stout” substyle in mind.  It has a nice roast and chocolate aroma/flavor but also includes a significant amount of hops that are typically associated with our region.  The resulting beer has a pronounced chocolaty roast flavor (slightly less than its counterpart Stuart) but also includes a nice hop aroma and flavor in the background.  A smoother mouthfeel than Stuart, Early Morning stout has great flavors and not just a dominant roast character like its mountainBeer counterpart.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":42,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,4,15,18,42,41],"updateDate":[2012,4,15,18,42,41],"style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish. Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas are prominent. Some slight roasted malt acidity is permissible and a medium- to full-bodied mouthfeel is appropriate. Hop bitterness may be moderate to high. Hop aroma and flavor is moderate to high, often with American citrus-type and/or resiny hop character. The perception of fruity esters is low. Roasted malt/barley astringency may be low but not excessive. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be negligible or not perceived. Head retention is excellent.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"60","abvMin":"5.7","abvMax":"8.8","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,28,43],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
