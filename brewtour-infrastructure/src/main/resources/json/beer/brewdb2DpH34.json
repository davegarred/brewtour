Right off the bat the nose hits you with sweet, skunky, and dank notes. The flavor follows suit with sweet tangerine, garlic, and more dank marijuana flavor before finishing dry with some light fruity bitterness.","abv":"5","ibu":"35","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":130,"createDate":[2015,3,19,20,32,47],"updateDate":[2015,3,19,20,32,47],"style":{"id":130,"categoryId":11,"name":"Experimental Beer (Lager or Ale)","shortName":"Experimental Beer","description":"An experimental beer is any beer (lager, ale or other) that is primarily grain-based and employs unusual techniques and/or ingredients. A minimum 51% of the fermentable carbohydrates must be derived from malted grains. The overall uniqueness of the process, ingredients used and creativity should be considered. Beers such as garden (vegetable), fruit, chocolate, coffee, spice, specialty or other beers that match existing categories should not be entered into this category. Beers not easily matched to existing style categories in a competition would often be entered into this category. Beers that are a combination of other categories (spice, smoke, specialty, porter, etc.) could also be entered into this category. A statement by the brewer explaining the experimental or other nature of the beer is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Generally, a 25-word statement would suffice in explaining the experimental nature of the beer.","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,46,2],"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}}}
