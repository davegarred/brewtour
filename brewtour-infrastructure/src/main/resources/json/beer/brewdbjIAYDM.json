{"breweryId":"Qtw1FC","id":"jIAYDM","name":"Cherrywood Smoked Porter","description":"Dark and full bodied, but not burnt or bitter. This brew has a nice chocolate flavor and a subtle smokey flavor. The Cherrywood is milder and sweeter than the Alder I used to use. Definitely a meal in a glass!","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":38,"createDate":[2014,9,24,17,38,26],"updateDate":[2014,9,24,17,38,26],"style":{"id":38,"categoryId":3,"name":"Smoke Porter","shortName":"Smoke Porter","description":"Smoke porters are chestnut brown to black in color. They can exhibit a mild to assertive smoke character in balance with other beer characters. Black malt character can be perceived in some porters, while others may be absent of strong roast character. Roast barley character should be absent. Medium to full malt sweetness, caramel and chocolate are acceptable along with medium to medium-high hop bitterness. These beers are usually medium to full bodied. Fruity esters are acceptable.
