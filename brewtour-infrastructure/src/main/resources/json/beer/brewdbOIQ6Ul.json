Great Western Premium 2-row and 42 pounds of Oregon-grown and processed raspberry puree is used to craft every colorful batch. Simple but delicious.

Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,44,21],"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
