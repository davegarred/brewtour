{"breweryId":"17tUiZ","id":"PMHd1p","name":"Coal Creek Porter","description":"Also a multiple medal winner at the Great American Beer Festival, Coal Creek Porter has a solid and loyal following among Big Time's customers. Impenetrably dark at first glance, Coal Creek shows rich red highlights when held to the light. Its blend of dark roasted malts combines with three other specialty malts and unmalted flaked barley to give Coal Creek a satisfying roasted flavor and smooth texture. It is heavily hopped in the finish with Yakima Centennial. Original gravity is approximately 15 degrees Plato (1.060 Specific Gravity), and alcohol content is 4.5% by weight.","abv":"4.5","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":18,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,43],"updateDate":[2015,12,15,21,19,24],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/PMHd1p/upload_xy9SVX-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/PMHd1p/upload_xy9SVX-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/PMHd1p/upload_xy9SVX-large.png"},"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.
