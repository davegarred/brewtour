{"breweryId":"h9obbv","id":"TM4SSU","name":"Backscatter Blackberry Wheat","description":"No extracts please!  We used twenty-five pounds of real blackberries per barrel of beer, to give our first berry beer a fresh and natural blackberry taste.  Using a light wheat ale base, our Backscatter Blackberry Wheat beer has a light bready undertone with a hint of blackberries.  With a bright berry color, this beer is a fun diversion from our typical ales.  A great summer brew!","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":119,"createDate":[2015,8,7,21,30,55],"updateDate":[2015,8,7,21,30,55],"style":{"id":119,"categoryId":11,"name":"Fruit Beer","shortName":"Fruit Beer","description":"Fruit beers are any beers using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either, the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities. Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,44,21],"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}}}
