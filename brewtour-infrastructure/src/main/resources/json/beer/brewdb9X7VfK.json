Bocks are traditionally brewed in the winter / early spring months and are served during the spring / early summer months. The Helles Bock has a copper golden color with a brilliant white head.

Very smooth and easy, drinkable yet deceptive at 6.4%.\n\nAll ingredients for the beer are imported from Germany. Brewed in accordance to the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot) of 1516.","abv":"6.4","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":89,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,45],"updateDate":[2012,3,22,13,5,5],"style":{"id":89,"categoryId":7,"name":"German-Style Heller Bock/Maibock","shortName":"Maibock","description":"The German word helle means light colored, and as such, a heller Bock is light straw to deep golden in color.
