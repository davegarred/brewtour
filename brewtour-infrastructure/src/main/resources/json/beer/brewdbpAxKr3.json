{"breweryId":"hvWfx5","id":"pAxKr3","name":"Bifr√∂st Winter Ale","description":"Pours golden with orange highlights. Smells alluringly sweet like caramel apples with a little spice and orange zest. Taste is bold and balanced with a good amount of citrus and earthy hop bitters to offset the malt character. Finishes dry with a bit of fruit.\r\n\r\nMalts: Pale with small amounts of Munich and Crystal\r\nHops: Bittered with Centennial, finished with Amarillo and Styrian Golding","abv":"7.5","ibu":"58","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":8,"styleId":124,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,48],"updateDate":[2015,12,15,21,19,34],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/pAxKr3/upload_J8D00a-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/pAxKr3/upload_J8D00a-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/pAxKr3/upload_J8D00a-large.png"},"style":{"id":124,"categoryId":11,"name":"Herb and Spice Beer","shortName":"Spice Beer","description":"Herb beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and/or spices used may not always be identifiable. Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,44,45],"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":8,"name":"Winter","description":"Available during the winter months."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
