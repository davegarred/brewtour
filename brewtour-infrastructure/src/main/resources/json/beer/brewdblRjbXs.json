{"breweryId":"h9obbv","id":"lRjbXs","name":"Dysprosium Dunkelweizen","description":"Dunkel is German for dark and Weisen is German for wheat.  Yes, you guessed it - this is a dark wheat beer.  It is medium brown in color and is a mild, full-flavored brew.  The rich, unfiltered body holds a dark wheat flavor while a medium dose of hops follows with a slightly bitter bite.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":52,"createDate":[2015,8,7,21,21,58],"updateDate":[2015,8,7,21,21,58],"style":{"id":52,"categoryId":4,"name":"South German-Style Dunkel Weizen / Dunkel Weissbier","shortName":"Dunkelweizen","description":"This beer style is characterized by a distinct sweet maltiness and a chocolate-like character from roasted malt. Estery and phenolic elements of this Weissbier should be evident but subdued. Color can range from copper-brown to dark brown. Dunkel Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated, and hop bitterness is low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Usually dark barley malts are used in conjunction with dark cara or color malts, and the percentage of wheat malt is at least 50 percent. If this is served with yeast, the beer may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"10","srmMax":"19","ogMin":"1.048","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,30,9],"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}}}
