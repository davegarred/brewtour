Hop aroma should be minimal and flavor can vary from none to medium in character intensity. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas can contribute to the character of this ale. Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A rich, often sweet and complex estery character may be evident. Very low levels of diacetyl are acceptable. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong.)","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"65","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"11","srmMin":"8","srmMax":"21","ogMin":"1.06","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.04","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,21,5],"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."}}
