{"breweryId":"5K9U34","id":"1zKQj1","name":"Boulder Bend Dunkelweizen","description":"Boulder Bend Dunkelweizen is an exceptional creation. This is an unfiltered dark Hefeweizen, with a gently sweet character infusing its medium-bodied smoothness. Notes of chocolate and caramel mingle with a cereal malt flavor contributed by additions of malted wheat. Other Northwest examples of this classic German style are rare and few. Certainly none are as tasty.","abv":"4.7","ibu":"25","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":52,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,53],"updateDate":[2015,12,15,21,25,19],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/1zKQj1/upload_ZfTUpZ-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/1zKQj1/upload_ZfTUpZ-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/1zKQj1/upload_ZfTUpZ-large.png"},"style":{"id":52,"categoryId":4,"name":"South German-Style Dunkel Weizen / Dunkel Weissbier","shortName":"Dunkelweizen","description":"This beer style is characterized by a distinct sweet maltiness and a chocolate-like character from roasted malt. Estery and phenolic elements of this Weissbier should be evident but subdued. Color can range from copper-brown to dark brown. Dunkel Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated, and hop bitterness is low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Usually dark barley malts are used in conjunction with dark cara or color malts, and the percentage of wheat malt is at least 50 percent. If this is served with yeast, the beer may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"10","srmMax":"19","ogMin":"1.048","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,30,9],"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
