{"breweryId":"WF34ng","id":"6sisOd","name":"Crossfire IPA","description":"Our flagship IPA is brewed in the West Coast style and inspired by the 1947 film noir of the same name starring the three Roberts (Mitchum, Ryan, and Young). Crossfire has a bold hop presence with notes of citrus and pine. Pale, Munich, and Crystal Malts provide a strong malt backbone, making this IPA extremely balanced and drinkable.","abv":"6","ibu":"66","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":30,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2014,9,10,20,39,53],"updateDate":[2014,9,18,11,7,26],"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
