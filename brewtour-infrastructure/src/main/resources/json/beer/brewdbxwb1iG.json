{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"xwb1iG","name":"Colonial Common","description":"Our Colonial Common is brewed with 100% Northern Brewer Leaf hops for bittering, flavor, and aroma. We hopped this beer to a moderate level and used a basic malt profile for the backbone of the beer allowing the hop characteristics to come through.  The hops lend this to be a nice, refreshing beer and woody notes are present.  However, we also get mint notes that we have never identified in a beer before, even in other commercial examples.  See if you agree, or if itâ€™s just the power of suggestion.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":110,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,4,15,18,26,20],"updateDate":[2012,4,15,18,26,20],"style":{"id":110,"categoryId":11,"name":"California Common Beer","shortName":"California Common","description":"California Common Beer is light amber to amber in color and is medium bodied.
