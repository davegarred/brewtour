{"breweryId":"CFmMeZ","id":"Yf27T5","name":"Khaos Kölsch","description":"A crisp yet smooth straw-colored ale, with a medium-light body. A delicately balanced beer showcasing subtle fruit flavors and aromas paired with a subdued maltiness. Styled after the ale of West-Central Germany, where the town of Cologne (Köln) is the home of Kölsch beer. In a country known for its lagers, this golden ale is a complex, yet subtle treat. Served in a traditional German crafted tall, narrow 200ml glass called a “Stange” or “pole”.","abv":"5","ibu":"21","isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":45,"createDate":[2015,7,24,20,33,14],"updateDate":[2015,7,24,20,33,14],"style":{"id":45,"categoryId":4,"name":"German-Style Kölsch / Köln-Style Kölsch","shortName":"Kölsch","description":"Kölsch is warm fermented and aged at cold temperatures (German ale or alt-style beer). Kölsch is characterized by a golden to straw color and a slightly dry, subtly sweet softness on the palate, yet crisp. Good, dense head retention is desirable. Light pearapple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Caramel character should not be evident. The body is light to medium-light. This beer has low hop flavor and aroma with medium bitterness. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all. Chill haze should be absent.","ibuMin":"18","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.3","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"6","ogMin":"1.042","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,29,4],"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}}}
