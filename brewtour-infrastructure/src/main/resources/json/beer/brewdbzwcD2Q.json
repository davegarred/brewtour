{"breweryId":"Bp3teL","id":"zwcD2Q","name":"Red Alt","description":"Our take on a German style alt bier.  Alt designates “old” which means an ale brewed and aged for extended conditioning to take on characteristics of a lager.  Our take on alt bier is to amp up the hop profile to help celebrate the eastern Washington hop growing area and the impact on the world brewing community.  Keeping the malt profile sweet makes this one work.  This was a GABF Gold medal winner in 2014.  Can we repeat? We sure hope so! The hops include Tettnanger and Pearle.","abv":"5.6","ibu":"31","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Try it with a brat!","availableId":1,"styleId":55,"glasswareId":5,"srmId":13,"createDate":[2014,9,20,3,3,31],"updateDate":[2015,8,20,14,13,33],"style":{"id":55,"categoryId":4,"name":"German-Style Altbier","shortName":"Altbier","description":"German-Style Altbiers are copper to dark brown ales, originally from the Düsseldorf area.
