{"breweryId":"5njNsw","id":"JvfxL6","name":"Helles Lager","description":"Golden, medium body, bready, restrained bitterness\r\n\r\nMunich’s response to the foreign pilsner was the “Helles”. Less hop flavor and bitterness than the Pilsner, the main highlight of the Helles is its bready, malty character. Today Helles beer is the everyday drinking beer in Germany.  Chuckanut's Helles is malty, balanced, easy-drinking typical of it's “liquid bread” character. Chuckanut Helles is a big winner at the most notable beer competitions in America winning Gold at the GABF 2011, NABA 2011, and WA Beer Awards 2013!","abv":"5","ibu":"20","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Helles goes very well with grilled sandwiches and pressed Panini. The malt character pairs up with nutty chickpea and sesame flavors, it’s a great match with our Hummus wrap or plate. Helles has a good relationship with shellfish including scallops. Roasted chicken and turkey will appreciate the breadiness of the beer including the stuffing as well. Just about any pork dish matches beautifully with the maltiness of Helles. Roasted pork with bacon, sauerkraut, and potato dumplings is a classic Bavarian dish. The sweetness of these meats and maltiness of the beer goes hand in hand while the carbonation and hop bitterness cuts through everything else. Salads are a great match as well, especially if they include cheese, ham or bacon such as Chuckanut’s Bacon Bleu Salad.","styleId":78,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,43,22],"updateDate":[2015,12,16,14,33],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/JvfxL6/upload_7xh1K5-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/JvfxL6/upload_7xh1K5-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/JvfxL6/upload_7xh1K5-large.png"},"style":{"id":78,"categoryId":7,"name":"Münchner (Munich)-Style Helles","shortName":"Helles","description":"This beer should be perceived as having low bitterness. It is a medium-bodied, malt-emphasized beer with malt character often balanced with low levels of yeast produced sulfur compounds (character). Certain renditions of this beer style have  a perceivable level of hop flavor (note: hop flavor does not imply hop bitterness) and character but it is essentially balanced with malt character to retain its style identity. Malt character is sometimes bread-like yet always reminiscent of freshly and very lightly toasted malted barley. There should not be any caramel character. Color is light straw to golden. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze.","ibuMin":"18","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"6","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,36,40],"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
