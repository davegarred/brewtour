The secret is the Mosaic hops that give a vibe of stone fruit, subtle grapefruit and delicate grassy-malty finish.  In true Heathen fashion, this beer is firmly planted in the gray area between pale and IPA.","abv":"5.8","ibu":"43","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":29,"glasswareId":5,"srmId":7,"createDate":[2014,4,9,9,47,19],"updateDate":[2015,12,17,12,1,23],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/JpS1EU/upload_NswSxQ-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/JpS1EU/upload_NswSxQ-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/JpS1EU/upload_NswSxQ-large.png"},"style":{"id":29,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Strong Pale Ale","shortName":"American Strong Pale","description":"American strong pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color. The style is characterized by floral and citrus-like American-variety hops used to produce high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Note that floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American strong pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruityester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"40","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"5.5","abvMax":"6.3","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,26,32],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]},"srm":{"id":7,"name":"7","hex":"F39C00"}}
