Hop flavor and aroma character may be evident at the brewer's discretion. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character and very low diacetyl (butterscotch) character are acceptable in aroma and flavor, but should be minimized in this form of bitter. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3","abvMax":"4.1","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"12","ogMin":"1.033","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,18,39],"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}}}
