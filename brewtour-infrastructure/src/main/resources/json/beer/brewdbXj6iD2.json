{"breweryId":"1KX35c","id":"Xj6iD2","name":"Bainbridge Bitter Pale Ale","description":"THE BEER: Bainbridge Bitter Pale Ale is a classic well-balanced northwest pale ale. Hoppy, but with malt backbone to support it, making it pleasantly approachable. Apollo, Cascade and Willamette hops. ESB, Crystal 40, Dextrine and Sour malts.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY: In 1841, Bainbridge Island was named by the Wilkes Expedition in honor of Commodore William Bainbridge (1774 â€“ 1833), famous captain of the 44 gun frigate USS Constitution in the War of 1812. Our pale ale is, in turn, named in honor of both the heroic Commodore Bainbridge, and our home, Bainbridge Island.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"40","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":25,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,9,15,13,20,52],"updateDate":[2014,10,16,20,23,52],"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color. The style is characterized by fruity, floral and citrus-like American-variety hop character producing medium to medium-high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Note that the \"traditional\" style of this beer has its origins with certain floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American hop varietals. One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"42","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.6","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,25,18],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
