{"breweryId":"5K9U34","id":"ypTJyq","name":"Trout Stout","description":"Full bodied, complex, and top hat black, Trout Stout boasts a distinctly dry roasted flavor and exceptional malt character. Here, hops play a subtle supporting role. Commanding center stage is a hearty ensemble of five varieties of malt. Roasted unmalted barley joins these to achieve this rich aleâ€™s signature coffee-roasted flavor.  \r\n\r\nWe recommend Trout Stout as an excellent accompaniment to fine foods, especially oysters and other treats from the sea. Some seasoned stout lovers say this ale makes a satisfying meal in itself. While we cordially invite you to judge for yourself, please remember: Trout Stout appears only during the cooler months, and elusively at that. So, keep your eyes peeled, your rod limber, and be sure to catch your limit before it gets away.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"31","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":42,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,44,25],"updateDate":[2015,12,16,5,15,41],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/ypTJyq/upload_hsdM6k-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/ypTJyq/upload_hsdM6k-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/ypTJyq/upload_hsdM6k-large.png"},"style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.
