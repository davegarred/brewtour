Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas are prominent. Some slight roasted malt acidity is permissible and a medium- to full-bodied mouthfeel is appropriate. Hop bitterness may be moderate to high. Hop aroma and flavor is moderate to high, often with American citrus-type and/or resiny hop character. The perception of fruity esters is low. Roasted malt/barley astringency may be low but not excessive. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be negligible or not perceived. Head retention is excellent.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"60","abvMin":"5.7","abvMax":"8.8","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,28,43],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not available."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
