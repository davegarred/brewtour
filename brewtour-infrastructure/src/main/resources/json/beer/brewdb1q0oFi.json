This is not a fullbodied beer, but rather a moderate body gently enhances malt flavor and aroma with low to moderate levels of sweetness. Hop bitterness is low to medium in character. Noble-type hop flavor and aroma should be low but perceptible. There should be no fruity esters. Diacetyl should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"22","ibuMax":"30","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"25","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,37,12],"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
