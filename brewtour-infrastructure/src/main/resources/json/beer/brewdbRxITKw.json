{"breweryId":"vR4nXO","id":"RxITKw","name":"253 Ale","description":"This bold amber is hoppy and unfiltered in the classic Pacific Northwest Style. We combine premium 2-Row and Crystal malts to form a pleasant malty base, then add enough Cascade and Centennial hops to create a balanced beer with a citrusy hop finish. This beer is easy to enjoy by itself and pairs well with most foods.  We enjoy \"keeping it in the 253\".","abv":"6","ibu":"40","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,37],"updateDate":[2012,3,22,13,5,15],"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
