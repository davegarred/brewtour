{"breweryId":"NfJcL9","id":"jO7fPh","name":"Golden Lilly Lager","description":"German for March beer, which was then lagered in cold cellars until the famed Oktoberfest. You'll love this authentic malty flavour, reminiscent of marshmallow and caramel candies with hints of vanilla and spice, balanced by flowery hops. Tea-like tannins and a subtle mineral water essence in the mouthfeel. Pleasant and surprisingly strong with a clean bittersweet aftertaste.","abv":"5.8","ibu":"24","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":81,"createDate":[2015,3,13,18,55,39],"updateDate":[2015,3,13,18,55,39],"style":{"id":81,"categoryId":7,"name":"German-Style Märzen","shortName":"Märzen","description":"Märzens are characterized by a medium body and broad range of color. They can range from golden to reddish orange. Sweet maltiness should dominate slightly over a clean hop bitterness. Malt character should be light-toasted rather than strongly caramel (though a low level of light caramel character is acceptable). Bread or biscuit-like malt character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Hop aroma and flavor should be low but notable. Ale-like fruity esters should not be perceived. Diacetyl and chill haze should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"18","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"5.3","abvMax":"5.9","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"15","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,36,50],"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}}}
