This beer does not offer an overly sweet impression, but rather a mild balance between malt sweetness, hop bitterness and light to moderate mouthfeel. A classic Münchner Dunkel should have chocolate-like, roast malt, bread-like or biscuit-like aroma that comes from the use of Munich dark malt. Chocolate or roast malts can be used, but the percentage used should be minimal. Noble-type hop flavor and aroma should be low but perceptible. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Ale-like fruity esters and chill haze should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"16","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.048","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,37,8],"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}}}
