{"breweryId":"nFgA09","id":"mTiYRK","name":"Shticky Blonde","description":"Derek started working on this particular recipe about 4 years ago. It started as a lager style, but switched to a Kolsch Ale style about 2 years ago. The finished product has not changed much over the years. Golden color, light carbonation, malty tones, without much hoppiness. Currently runs around 6% ABV. There is a presence of honey, but ever so slightly. The finish is very nice, soft, and light. Every sip begs for another.","abv":"6","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":36,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,2,15,11,28,40],"updateDate":[2012,3,22,13,5,49],"style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color. They have a crisp, dry palate, light to medium body, and light malt sweetness. Low to medium hop aroma may be present but does not dominate. Bitterness is low to medium. Fruity esters may be perceived but do not predominate. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill haze should be absent.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"7","ogMin":"1.045","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,27,26],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
