{"breweryId":"h6TO1Z","id":"zs6S6D","name":"Wicked Riff India Pale Ale","description":"This is a Northwest take on a resurrected beer style that dates back to the British colonial empire of the 1800's. As the story goes, the style was created so that the beer would survive the long journey to India on one of the British East India ships. A beer with more hops and higher alcohol content will go longer before spoiling due to its higher resistance to bacteria and mold growth. Hops have an antibiotic effect that acts against bacterial strains while leaving brewer's yeast relatively unaffected. As a result, IPA has lots of hops.\r\n\r\nTBB's IPA is malted towards the dry side, making it quite quaffable (yes, that's a technical term) rather than malty and hard to get through. It is quite pale in color and has a slightly toasted malt character. Five different hops are used during the brewing and dry-hopping for this IPA, giving it a moderately complex aroma with strong citrus and floral notes.","abv":"6.9","ibu":"85","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":30,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,9,8,11,20,16],"updateDate":[2012,9,8,11,20,16],"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
