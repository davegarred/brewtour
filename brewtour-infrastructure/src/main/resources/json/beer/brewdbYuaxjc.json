{"breweryId":"17tUiZ","id":"Yuaxjc","name":"Ave Rat Malt Liquor","description":"Brewed in celebration of the U-District’s most misunderstood denizen, the “Ave Rat.” Stylistically, it’s a pre-Prohibition West Coast-style adjunct lager, brewed with Pilsner malt, flaked maize, and Styrian Goldings, which blend together into a rich, golden beer that is crisp and clean and only a little bit edgy. O.G. 16.0, 6.25% ABV","abv":"6.25","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":100,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,43],"updateDate":[2015,5,15,15,59,5],"style":{"id":100,"categoryId":8,"name":"American-Style Malt Liquor","shortName":"Malt Liquor","description":"High in starting gravity and alcoholic strength, this style is somewhat diverse. Some American malt liquors are just slightly stronger than American lagers, while others approach bock strength. Some residual sweetness is perceived. Hop rates are very low, contributing little bitterness and virtually no hop aroma or flavor. Perception of sweet-fruity esters and complex alcohols (though not solvent-like) are acceptable at low levels. Chill haze and diacetyl should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"12","ibuMax":"23","abvMin":"6.25","abvMax":"7.5","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"5","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,41,16],"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
