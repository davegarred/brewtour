{"breweryId":"2BFwoJ","id":"TtTMdQ","name":"HALE'S FRESH HOP ALE","description":"We've centrifuged this year's Fresh Hop Ale and it's now available for tasting!  Pale golden in color, this beer imparts a subtle citrus sweetness on top of a pleasant grassy/grain aroma. The flavor initially showcases the barley and oats used in the recipe, then shifts right into the juicy Cascade hop profile (citrusy & herbal).

These ales are hopped predominantly with fresh (newly harvested and kilned) and/or undried (“wet”) hops. These beers will exhibit especially aromas and flavors of green, almost chlorophyll-like or other fresh hop characters, in harmony with the characters of the base style of the beer. These beers may be aged and enjoyed after the initial “fresh-hop” character diminishes. Unique character from “aged” fresh hop beers may emerge, but they have yet to be defined.","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,25,25],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."}}
