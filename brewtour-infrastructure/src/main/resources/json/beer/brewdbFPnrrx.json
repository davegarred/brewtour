{"breweryId":"VOnxph","id":"FPnrrx","name":"Smelters Stout","description":"Mmmmm... stout. If you don't know why they call it \"stout\", that's because you haven't tasted it. I make a couple of different stouts, each with its own dash of dark brilliance to make it unique. The rumor is, you know it's ready when a chopstick will stand upright in a pint. Of course, that's not true, I use a regular spoon.","abv":"9.5","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":42,"createDate":[2015,8,5,23,39,41],"updateDate":[2015,8,5,23,39,41],"style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish. Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas are prominent. Some slight roasted malt acidity is permissible and a medium- to full-bodied mouthfeel is appropriate. Hop bitterness may be moderate to high. Hop aroma and flavor is moderate to high, often with American citrus-type and/or resiny hop character. The perception of fruity esters is low. Roasted malt/barley astringency may be low but not excessive. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be negligible or not perceived. Head retention is excellent.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"60","abvMin":"5.7","abvMax":"8.8","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,28,43],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}}}
