{"breweryId":"NfJcL9","id":"AWcO2m","name":"Brush Fit Brown","description":"Treat yourself to an English holiday without leaving the Pacific Northwest with a pint of this delicious old-timey Brown Ale. Bready, toasty, biscuity, caramelly, nutty, with hints of toffee, coffee, chocolate, balanced by tangy orange marmalade hoppy notes. Think Newcastle but way more flavorful. Pair it with some ripe cheese and crusty bread and you’ve got yourself a meal…one of many if you’re a Hobbit.","abv":"4.5","ibu":"30","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":12,"createDate":[2015,3,13,18,25,15],"updateDate":[2015,3,13,18,25,15],"style":{"id":12,"categoryId":1,"name":"English-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"English Brown","description":"English brown ales range from copper to brown in color. They have medium body and range from dry to sweet maltiness with very little hop flavor or aroma. Roast malt tones may sometimes contribute to the flavor and aroma profile. Low to medium-low levels of fruity-ester flavors are appropriate. Diacetyl should be very low, if evident. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"13","srmMax":"25","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,20,51],"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."}}
