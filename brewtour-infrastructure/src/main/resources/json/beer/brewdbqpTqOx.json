Each coffee in this blend is individually roasted to preserve the unique flavor and aroma of each country of origin. This artisan blend is then slow-brewed to create a full-bodied, delicious complement to our Hooligan Stout.","ibu":"50","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":123,"createDate":[2015,2,26,18,38,42],"updateDate":[2015,2,26,18,38,42],"style":{"id":123,"categoryId":11,"name":"Coffee-Flavored Beer","shortName":"Coffee Beer","description":"Coffee beers use coffee in any of its forms other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character.
