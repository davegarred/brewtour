{"breweryId":"fWfbGJ","id":"eRO09j","name":"G String Blonde","description":"Our G String Blonde is named after the G String on the guitar.  What were you thinking it was named after?  It is a Blonde style beer that has a fantastic hop aroma  and flavor without a lot of bitterness and is a great warm day thirst quencher and also a great all around session beer.  It's a little bit of an IPA wannabe and has some characteristics of a pale ale while retaining that nice straw color of a blonde.  It is about 5% ABV which allows you to have more than just a couple on a hot day.","abv":"5","ibu":"30","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":6,"styleId":36,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,2,8,11,28,40],"updateDate":[2015,12,16,15,38,51],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/eRO09j/upload_M07LwV-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/eRO09j/upload_M07LwV-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/eRO09j/upload_M07LwV-large.png"},"style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.
