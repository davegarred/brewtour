{"breweryId":"NUZvIK","id":"qFhI95","name":"L.O.B.","description":"This stout has 8 different grains in the mash. Lots of Barley is an understatement.  There is a ridiculous amount of grain in this beer. The grain sweetness is offset with a substantial amount of hops. Notes of coffee and chocolate are prevalent in this beer. Willamette, fuggles, and perle are the hops used in this export style stout.","abv":"7","ibu":"53.5","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":24,"createDate":[2015,3,6,21,51,9],"updateDate":[2015,3,6,21,51,9],"style":{"id":24,"categoryId":2,"name":"Foreign (Export)-Style Stout","shortName":"Export Stout","description":"As with classic dry stouts, foreign-style stouts have an initial malt sweetness and caramel flavor with a distinctive dry-roasted bitterness in the finish. Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas are prominent. Some slight acidity is permissible and a medium- to full-bodied mouthfeel is appropriate. Bitterness may be high but the perception is often compromised by malt sweetness. Hop aroma and flavor should not be perceived. The perception of fruity esters is low. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be negligible or not perceived. Head retention is excellent.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"60","abvMin":"5.7","abvMax":"9.3","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.052","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,23,58],"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."}}
