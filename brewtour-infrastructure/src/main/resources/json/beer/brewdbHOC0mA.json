The combination of these two hops provide a beer that can only be described as dank, in a surprisingly good way. The beer has a slight roastiness from the Midnight wheat that gives the beer its black color. The finish is a spicy earthiness from lots of Rye malt with a slight citrus tone.","abv":"6.7","ibu":"75.2","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":41,"createDate":[2015,3,6,21,40,41],"updateDate":[2015,3,6,21,40,41],"style":{"id":41,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Black Ale","shortName":"Black Ale","description":"American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body.
