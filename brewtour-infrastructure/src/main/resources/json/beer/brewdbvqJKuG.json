They have medium body and range from dry to sweet maltiness with very little hop flavor or aroma. Roast malt tones may sometimes contribute to the flavor and aroma profile. Low to medium-low levels of fruity-ester flavors are appropriate. Diacetyl should be very low, if evident. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"13","srmMax":"25","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,20,51],"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}}}
