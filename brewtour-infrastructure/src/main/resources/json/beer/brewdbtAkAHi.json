{"breweryId":"h9obbv","id":"tAkAHi","name":"International Proton Pale Ale","description":"This beer is the result of the anarchy that ensues when you let technical types run amuk in the lab/brewhaus.  Logistical limitations disappear as we include an International pot-pouri of hops from the United States, Europe and the South Pacific.  These hops are scientifically chosen to provide an intense but clean bitterness and hop flavor appropriate for this style of Pale Ale.  The taste of this golden colored ale is dominated by hops, but contains an appropriate level of malt flavor as well.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"74","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":73,"createDate":[2015,8,7,22,3,14],"updateDate":[2015,8,7,22,3,14],"style":{"id":73,"categoryId":6,"name":"International-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"International Pale","description":"International-style pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
