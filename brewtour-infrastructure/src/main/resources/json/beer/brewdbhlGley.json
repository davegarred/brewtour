{"breweryId":"5K9U34","id":"hlGley","name":"Organic Blonde Seasonal Ale","description":"Light bodied and golden, Fish Tale Organic Blonde Ale is a matchless companion to the glories of a Cascadian summer. Brewed with just a schmatering of rye, Organic Blonde sports subtle spicy tones that complement the honey sweetness of its pale malt to a tee.\r\n\r\nTo balance its deliciously delicate malt character, we brew this Organic seasonal ale with Glacier hops. These impart a savory aromatic finish with just the gentlest tang. Whether served with saucy summer barbecue, or as a thirst quencher in its own right, Fish Tale Organic Blonde Ale perfects the sweet leisure of the summer days. Or nights.","abv":"4","ibu":"15","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":61,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,43,53],"updateDate":[2015,12,15,21,34,50],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/hlGley/upload_qTH9sZ-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/hlGley/upload_qTH9sZ-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/hlGley/upload_qTH9sZ-large.png"},"style":{"id":61,"categoryId":5,"name":"Belgian-Style Blonde Ale","shortName":"Belgian Blonde","description":"Belgian-style blond ales are characterized by low yet evident hop bitterness, flavor, and sometimes aroma.
