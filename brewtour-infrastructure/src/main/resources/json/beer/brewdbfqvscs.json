{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"fqvscs","name":"Enchantment Ale","description":"Enchantment ale is a saison, a style that is categorized as a ‘farmhouse ale.’  Indeed, there are (musty?) notes of straw and hay reminiscent of walking through a farm.  But these styles also have a nice fruity notes (apple and pear), with a slight perception of sweetness.  Using a cousin to the Belgian yeasts, these beers ferment dry and somewhat spicy.  Enchantment ale is a nice example of the basic style. We started with an above average specific gravity than normal and when it fermented very dry (just above the specific gravity of water) it produced a higher alcohol content than most of our mountainBeers.  We also added some grains of paradise adding to the spicy complexity on top of the other defining characteristics. Simply enchanting.","abv":"6.8","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":72,"glasswareId":6,"createDate":[2012,4,15,18,30,34],"updateDate":[2012,4,15,18,30,34],"style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.
