This style balances moderate bitterness and noble-type hop aroma and flavor with a malty, slightly sweet, medium body. Extremely low levels of diacetyl and low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character, if perceived, are characteristic of this style and both may accent malt aroma. A toasted-, biscuit-like, bready malt character along with low levels of sulfur compounds may be evident. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"7","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,36,3],"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
