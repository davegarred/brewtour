A big, chocolaty, hoppy brown brew, the only thing nutty about it are the brewers that make it.","abv":"6.2","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":37,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,52],"updateDate":[2012,9,8,11,52,13],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/pzHIoC/upload_d0Ylkd-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/pzHIoC/upload_d0Ylkd-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/pzHIoC/upload_d0Ylkd-large.png"},"style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.
