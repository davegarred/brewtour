They can range from golden to reddish orange. Sweet maltiness should dominate slightly over a clean hop bitterness. Malt character should be light-toasted rather than strongly caramel (though a low level of light caramel character is acceptable). Bread or biscuit-like malt character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Hop aroma and flavor should be low but notable. Ale-like fruity esters should not be perceived. Diacetyl and chill haze should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"18","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"5.3","abvMax":"5.9","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"15","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,36,50],"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not available."}}
