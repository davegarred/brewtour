{"breweryId":"dBrmRe","id":"KQuBHX","name":"Dry-Hopped Wheat Ale","description":"A perfect summer refresher. Grapefruity, clean, and modestly hoppy, this beer is somewhere straddling the line between a pale ale and a wheat. Citra and Amarillo hops fill the nose, the \"ahhhh\" after a swig is involuntary.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":4,"styleId":113,"createDate":[2014,1,22,0,1,50],"updateDate":[2015,6,18,16,44,49],"style":{"id":113,"categoryId":11,"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager without Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. A fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Appearance can be clear or with chill haze, golden to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,42,53],"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."}}
