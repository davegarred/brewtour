This year we chose Simcoe Hop for its outstanding flavor and aroma. The result: A crisp and refreshing Pale Ale with a pleasant hop presence that nudges the nose, tickles the tastebuds, and has a fantastically fresh finish!","abv":"5","ibu":"35","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":3,"styleId":26,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,42,42],"updateDate":[2015,12,16,10,35,26],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/HIViU6/upload_HGYsve-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/HIViU6/upload_HGYsve-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/HIViU6/upload_HGYsve-large.png"},"style":{"id":26,"categoryId":3,"name":"Fresh \"Wet\" Hop Ale","shortName":"Wet Hop Ale","description":"Any style of ale can be made into a fresh hop or wet hop version. These ales are hopped predominantly with fresh (newly harvested and kilned) and/or undried (“wet”) hops. These beers will exhibit especially aromas and flavors of green, almost chlorophyll-like or other fresh hop characters, in harmony with the characters of the base style of the beer. These beers may be aged and enjoyed after the initial “fresh-hop” character diminishes. Unique character from “aged” fresh hop beers may emerge, but they have yet to be defined.","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,25,25],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not available."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
