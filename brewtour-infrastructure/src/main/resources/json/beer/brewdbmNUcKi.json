{"breweryId":"CFmMeZ","id":"mNUcKi","name":"Crosscut Pilsner","description":"“A Cut Above”\r\nWe’ve brewed up a bit of our local logging history and crafted a Pilsner-Style Lager that offers up a hint of our home. Like the surrounding Northwest forests we call our back yard, this beer is complex in its subtleties. From a clean malty profile to a moderate Noble-hop flavor and aroma, our Lager combines local ingredients and inspiration, which results in a beer that's a cut above the rest.","abv":"5","ibu":"28","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":75,"glasswareId":4,"srmId":3,"createDate":[2014,6,10,12,43,11],"updateDate":[2015,12,17,14,31,13],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/mNUcKi/upload_T2E1PO-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/mNUcKi/upload_T2E1PO-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/mNUcKi/upload_T2E1PO-large.png"},"style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped. Perception of hop bitterness is medium to high. Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. It is a well-attenuated, medium-light bodied beer, but a malty residual sweetness can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character are below most beer drinkers' taste thresholds and are usually not detectable except to the trained or sensitive palate. Other fermentation or hop related sulfur compounds, when perceived at low levels, may be characteristic of this style. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,35,59],"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]},"srm":{"id":3,"name":"3","hex":"FFCA5A"}}
