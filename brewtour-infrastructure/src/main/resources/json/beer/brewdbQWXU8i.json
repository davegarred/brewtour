{"breweryId":"W37YiO","id":"QWXU8i","name":"Dark Star Imperial Oatmeal Stout","description":"Roasty, chocolate tones swirled with oatmeal smoothness and dark as the night. The Dark Star crashes, pouring its light into ashes, so follow as the Lady of Velvet in the nights of goodbye. This one is too smooth...and at 8.0% ABV, dangerous.","abv":"8","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":21,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,11,25,13,31,47],"updateDate":[2016,2,11,16,9,13],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/QWXU8i/upload_6Ov630-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/QWXU8i/upload_6Ov630-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/QWXU8i/upload_6Ov630-large.png"},"style":{"id":21,"categoryId":1,"name":"Oatmeal Stout","shortName":"Oatmeal Stout","description":"Oatmeal stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy. A roasted malt character which is caramel-like and chocolate-like should be evident - smooth and not bitter. Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas (chocolate and nut-like) are prominent. Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels. Original gravity range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"20","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,22,53],"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
