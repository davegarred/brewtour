Brewed using 100 percent Pilsner malt and Czech Pils yeast strain, this sessionable Pilsner offers notes of spice and grass, thanks to the Saaz and Perle hops used to create it.","abv":"4.8","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":6,"styleId":76,"createDate":[2013,8,13,19,6,10],"updateDate":[2015,12,17,4,11,34],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/oldejj/upload_2ToN3y-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/oldejj/upload_2ToN3y-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/oldejj/upload_2ToN3y-large.png"},"style":{"id":76,"categoryId":7,"name":"Bohemian-Style Pilsener","shortName":"Bohemian Pilsener","description":"Traditional Bohemian Pilseners are medium bodied, and they can be as dark as a light amber color. This style balances moderate bitterness and noble-type hop aroma and flavor with a malty, slightly sweet, medium body. Extremely low levels of diacetyl and low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character, if perceived, are characteristic of this style and both may accent malt aroma. A toasted-, biscuit-like, bready malt character along with low levels of sulfur compounds may be evident. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"7","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,36,3],"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":6,"name":"Summer","description":"Available during the summer months."}}
