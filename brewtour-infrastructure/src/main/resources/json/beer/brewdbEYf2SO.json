Pumpkin qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. These may or may not be spiced or flavored with other things. A statement by the brewer explaining the nature of the beer is essential for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with pumpkin, the brewer should also specify the classic style.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,44,28],"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]},"srm":{"id":17,"name":"17","hex":"B04500"}}
