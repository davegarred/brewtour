{"breweryId":"LqF5uF","id":"uG334u","name":"Joker Amber Ale","description":"This bold amber is hoppy and unfiltered in the classic Pacific Northwest Style. We combine premium 2-Row, Aromatic, Melanoidin, and Crystal malts to form a pleasant malty base, then add enough Crystal and Mt. Hood hops to create a balanced beer with a citrusy hop finish. This beer is easy to enjoy by itself, and pairs well with most foods.","abv":"6","ibu":"30","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":32,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2013,11,21,17,18,26],"updateDate":[2015,6,5,16,54,21],"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Amber/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.
