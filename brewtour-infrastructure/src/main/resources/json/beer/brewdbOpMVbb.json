{"breweryId":"YKa9wh","id":"OpMVbb","name":"Nut Brown","description":"Ah, Spring…the season that keeps us guessing.  Will it rain, or will the sun be out?  Do I take advantage of the last days of skiing, or the first days of hiking?  Do I put on jeans, or dare break out the shorts?  The season comes with enough uncertainty, so Redhook gives you something you can always count on…our Nut Brown Ale.  This medium dark beer is layered with rich malty aromas and flavors of chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, and a hint of vanilla.  Although it may be dark in color, it’s refreshingly smooth and highly sessionable.  Nut Brown is the perfect beer for spring.","abv":"5.8","ibu":"30","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":5,"styleId":10,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,43,47],"updateDate":[2015,12,15,21,53,4],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/OpMVbb/upload_bdX6PI-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/OpMVbb/upload_bdX6PI-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/OpMVbb/upload_bdX6PI-large.png"},"style":{"id":10,"categoryId":1,"name":"English-Style Pale Mild Ale","shortName":"English Pale Mild","description":"English pale mild ales range from golden to amber in color.
