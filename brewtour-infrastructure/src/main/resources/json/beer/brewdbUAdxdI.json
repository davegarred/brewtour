{"breweryId":"h9obbv","id":"UAdxdI","name":"Days Pay Amber","description":"On \"D-day\", June 6th, 1944, during World War II - 51,000 Hanford workers donated a full day's pay, collecting nearly $300,000.00 to buy a B-17 Bomber to give to the Army Air Force.\r\n\r\nWe found it fitting to name our newest seasonal ale after this historic event.  On the nose you will detect an earthy floral note that is followed by a faint smell of hops. Once you have had a sip, the toasted malt character fades into a strong hop bitterness. This Ale is similar to our Atomic Amber but with a more powerful kick, and will fly you into another dimension!","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":32,"createDate":[2015,8,7,22,48,32],"updateDate":[2015,8,7,22,48,32],"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Amber/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color. They are characterized by American-variety hops used to produce the perception of medium hop bitterness, flavor, and medium aroma. Amber ales have medium-high to high maltiness with medium to low caramel character. They should have medium to medium-high body. The style may have low levels of fruityester flavor and aroma. Diacetyl can be either absent or barely perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.
