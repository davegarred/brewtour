{"breweryId":"5K9U34","id":"4amUPc","name":"Bakke Hill Black Lager","description":"Bakke Hill Black Lager has an opaque, black color and a full, chocolaty or coffee flavor with a hint of vanilla. Although it shares some similar flavors, this German style is milder tasting and less bitter than British stouts or porters.\r\n\r\nIt is a light to medium-bodied, malt-accented dark brew, very opaque and deep-sepia in color, with a chewy texture and a firm, creamy, long-lasting head. In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced.","abv":"5","ibu":"25","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":7,"styleId":84,"createDate":[2014,11,12,16,59,35],"updateDate":[2015,12,17,19,50,26],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/4amUPc/upload_TvFEnG-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/4amUPc/upload_TvFEnG-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/4amUPc/upload_TvFEnG-large.png"},"style":{"id":84,"categoryId":7,"name":"German-Style Schwarzbier","shortName":"Schwarzbier","description":"These very dark brown to black beers have a mild roasted malt character without the associated bitterness. This is not a fullbodied beer, but rather a moderate body gently enhances malt flavor and aroma with low to moderate levels of sweetness. Hop bitterness is low to medium in character. Noble-type hop flavor and aroma should be low but perceptible. There should be no fruity esters. Diacetyl should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"22","ibuMax":"30","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"25","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,37,12],"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":7,"name":"Fall","description":"Available during the fall months."}}
