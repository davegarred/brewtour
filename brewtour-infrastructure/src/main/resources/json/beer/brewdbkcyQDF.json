{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"kcyQDF","name":"Stuart Stout","description":"Since Mt Stuart is one of the most noticeable, bold, non-volcanic peaks in WA we tried to make the beer bearing its name similar.  What better style for this than a stout?  Stuart Stout is a rich, full bodied, deeply roasty interpretation of the style.  It has a lot of roasted malts giving it a great stout flavor, which is supported by some sweetness, a rich body, and just enough hops for support in the background.  A fine beer to drink anytime, but best enjoyed in front of a fire on a cold rainy winter evening.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":42,"createDate":[2012,4,15,17,21,5],"updateDate":[2012,4,15,18,16,56],"style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish. Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas are prominent. Some slight roasted malt acidity is permissible and a medium- to full-bodied mouthfeel is appropriate. Hop bitterness may be moderate to high. Hop aroma and flavor is moderate to high, often with American citrus-type and/or resiny hop character. The perception of fruity esters is low. Roasted malt/barley astringency may be low but not excessive. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be negligible or not perceived. Head retention is excellent.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"60","abvMin":"5.7","abvMax":"8.8","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,28,43],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."}}
