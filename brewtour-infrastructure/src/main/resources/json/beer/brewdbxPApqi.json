{"breweryId":"q0EsJc","id":"xPApqi","name":"Stoup Bavarian Hefeweizen","description":"Close your eyes, take a sip of this beer and youâ€™re sure to be transported to a tree-lined, sun-speckled biergarten in Munich. We honor tradition by brewing this beer using decoction mashing techniques and fermenting with a German yeast strain that imparts prominent banana and clove notes. The wheat gives this beer a crisp, slightly tart, refreshing finish.","abv":"5","ibu":"13","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":6,"styleId":48,"glasswareId":9,"srmId":5,"createDate":[2014,9,10,15,48,45],"updateDate":[2014,12,10,18,13,21],"style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen / Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-, nutmeg-like, mildly smoke-like or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters should be present at low to medium-high levels. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent or present at very low levels. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,29,27],"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":6,"name":"Summer","description":"Available during the summer months."},"glass":{"id":9,"name":"Weizen","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]},"srm":{"id":5,"name":"5","hex":"FBB123"}}
