{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"EiR9zn","name":"Picket Porter","description":"We attempted to make picket porter a perfect partner to the Snowfield winter: A very flavorful beer but yet easy drinking with a lower alcohol content.  It is very drinkable and has a lower alcohol content that would be similar to the historical versions of the entires, mentioned above.  Also we stayed true to the porter’s origins and used all english style hops for flavor and aroma (fuggles) and an English yeast, which resulted in a very mildly pleasant fruity and grassy flavor.  However, the flavor that dominates (but definitely does not overpower) the beer is the chocolaty and mild roast character, more reminiscent of “bigger” porters of the US. The combination produces a flavorful and easy drinking beer, perfect for dark winter Seattle days and nights.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":18,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,4,15,18,40,48],"updateDate":[2012,4,15,18,40,48],"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.
