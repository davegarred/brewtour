{"breweryId":"CFmMeZ","id":"NLyL6m","name":"Lokal","description":"We’ve milled, mashed, brewed and fermented the local area and crafted a lager that’s golden like the sunrise and smooth like river rock. Just as you would find in our beautiful surroundings, this beer has a bit of everything. From a slightly sweet malty profile to a low noble hop aroma, our lager combines local ingredients as well as inspiration to offer up a hint of our home.","abv":"5","ibu":"16","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":3,"styleId":78,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2013,1,23,1,25,34],"updateDate":[2014,10,30,18,28,19],"style":{"id":78,"categoryId":7,"name":"Münchner (Munich)-Style Helles","shortName":"Helles","description":"This beer should be perceived as having low bitterness. It is a medium-bodied, malt-emphasized beer with malt character often balanced with low levels of yeast produced sulfur compounds (character). Certain renditions of this beer style have  a perceivable level of hop flavor (note: hop flavor does not imply hop bitterness) and character but it is essentially balanced with malt character to retain its style identity. Malt character is sometimes bread-like yet always reminiscent of freshly and very lightly toasted malted barley. There should not be any caramel character. Color is light straw to golden. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze.","ibuMin":"18","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"6","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,36,40],"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not available."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
