{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"Wo6J5B","name":"Agassiz Acai","description":"We brewed Agassiz with more than 60 percent rice.  However we didn’t stop there. We added cooked rice to the fermenter (yes, the fermenter) to try to leach a bunch of the starches and rice character from the rice (we all know that light beers made with rice have no rice character and virtually no character at all). We then used a sake yeast to ferment the beer. After fermenting we threw a kink into the “sake beer” idea and added acai puree to get a nice fruit balance on top of the starchy rice backbone.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":125,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,4,15,18,33,21],"updateDate":[2012,4,15,18,33,21],"style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley. Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,44,53],"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
