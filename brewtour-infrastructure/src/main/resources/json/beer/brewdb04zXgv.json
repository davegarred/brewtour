{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"04zXgv","name":"Annapurna Black Ale","description":"As the fires in the hearth have started and the days are shortened, there is a cold, dark feeling in this “shoulder season”.  The seasonal beer goes through the same progression. We wanted to make a darker beer that had a lot of hop character blending the recent harvest with the upcoming winter.  To accomplish the feat we used plenty of de-bittered black malt and Cascadian style hops. To accompany the shoulder season, the beer retains a thinner body with a nice blend of NW hops and the dark malts. We’ll call it a NW Black ale, as opposed to a Cascadian dark ale, since Annapurna has more dark malts that share the stage with the hop character.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":41,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,4,15,18,36,37],"updateDate":[2012,4,15,18,36,37],"style":{"id":41,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Black Ale","shortName":"Black Ale","description":"American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body. Fruity, floral and herbal character from hops of all origins may contribute character. The style is further characterized by a balanced and moderate degree of caramel malt and dark roasted malt flavor and aroma. High astringency and high degree of burnt roast malt character should be absent.","ibuMin":"50","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"6","abvMax":"7.5","srmMin":"35","srmMax":"35","ogMin":"1.056","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,28,36],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
