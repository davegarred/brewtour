{"breweryId":"NfJcL9","id":"aLI5s0","name":"Belgian Dubbel","description":"As brewed unto God by Trappist monks since the Middle Ages. Subtle yet seriously complex. Grainy and nutty and fruity with hints of black pepper, clove, honey, brown sugar, plums, black cherries, raisins. Flowery noble hops and elevated alcohol combine into a great perfume-y aroma. Hell, if it’s good enough for God, it’s good enough for the rest of us!","abv":"7.2","ibu":"30","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":58,"createDate":[2015,3,13,18,57,15],"updateDate":[2015,3,13,18,57,15],"style":{"id":58,"categoryId":5,"name":"Belgian-Style Dubbel","shortName":"Belgian Dubbel","description":"This medium-bodied, red to dark brown colored ale has a malty sweetness and chocolate-like caramel aroma. A light hop flavor and/or aroma is acceptable. Dubbels are also characterized by low-medium to medium bitterness. No diacetyl is acceptable. Yeastgenerated fruity esters (especially banana) are appropriate at low levels. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Often bottle conditioned a slight yeast haze and flavor may be evident.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"30","abvMin":"6.25","abvMax":"7.5","srmMin":"16","srmMax":"36","ogMin":"1.06","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,31,45],"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}}}
