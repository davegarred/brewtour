{"breweryId":"Zwlamt","id":"BRAI6X","name":"Cincinnatus Imperial Brown Ale","description":"Imperial Brown Ale with a deep balanced flavor. High gravity English style beer with a malt forward profile. The dark grains are present with very little bitterness so the subtle sweetness really comes out. Certainly not traditional but definitely delicious.","abv":"8.4","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":12,"createDate":[2014,9,23,17,23,21],"updateDate":[2014,9,23,17,30,19],"style":{"id":12,"categoryId":1,"name":"English-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"English Brown","description":"English brown ales range from copper to brown in color. They have medium body and range from dry to sweet maltiness with very little hop flavor or aroma. Roast malt tones may sometimes contribute to the flavor and aroma profile. Low to medium-low levels of fruity-ester flavors are appropriate. Diacetyl should be very low, if evident. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"13","srmMax":"25","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,20,51],"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}}}
