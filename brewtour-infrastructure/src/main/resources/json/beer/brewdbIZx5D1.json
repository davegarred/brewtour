{"breweryId":"g5GKTi","id":"IZx5D1","name":"Pilsner","description":"Our pilsner is a traditional Northern German Style Pilsner. It has a fantastic malty aroma with a slight spice from the hops. The head is brilliant white and floats on the clean pale lager. The sparkling mouthfeel gives way to a soft malt sweetness that is followed by a long, dry, crisp finish. The balanced clean finish taunts the mouth to take another drink. Lagered for a minimum of 8-12 weeks to ensure smoothness and drinkability.\r\n\r\nAll ingredients for the beer are imported from Germany. Brewed in accordance to the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot) of 1516.","abv":"4.7","ibu":"28","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":75,"glasswareId":3,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,43,58],"updateDate":[2012,3,22,13,5,5],"style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped. Perception of hop bitterness is medium to high. Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. It is a well-attenuated, medium-light bodied beer, but a malty residual sweetness can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character are below most beer drinkers' taste thresholds and are usually not detectable except to the trained or sensitive palate. Other fermentation or hop related sulfur compounds, when perceived at low levels, may be characteristic of this style. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,35,59],"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":3,"name":"Mug","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
