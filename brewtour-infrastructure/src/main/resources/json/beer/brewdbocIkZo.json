{"breweryId":"iWV3FQ","id":"ocIkZo","name":"Cascadian Dark Ale","description":"Pale & dark roasted malts join together with generous portions of Yakima Valley hops in this unique new style of beer that was born in the Northwest. All the rich malty goodness you would expect from dark ale is accented by the hop kick of an IPA. Citrus and floral aroma is complimented by velvety smooth roasted malt flavor. A Northwest style of beer which boldly exhibits the wealth of local ingredients that make this such a great beer region.","abv":"7","isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":41,"createDate":[2015,7,24,19,47,16],"updateDate":[2015,7,24,19,47,16],"style":{"id":41,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style Black Ale","shortName":"Black Ale","description":"American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body. Fruity, floral and herbal character from hops of all origins may contribute character. The style is further characterized by a balanced and moderate degree of caramel malt and dark roasted malt flavor and aroma. High astringency and high degree of burnt roast malt character should be absent.","ibuMin":"50","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"6","abvMax":"7.5","srmMin":"35","srmMax":"35","ogMin":"1.056","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,28,36],"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}}}
