{"breweryId":"h9obbv","id":"wcxh4E","name":"Beta Blocker Bitter","description":"Try saying the name of this beer 3 times in a row.  It may be hard to say, but it is enjoyable to drink.  Try one today!  In the English tradition, this beer is brewed with pale malted barley, a small amount of wheat & crystal malt and lots and lots of hops.  The flavor is dominated by UK Kent Gouldings hops which are used in the brewing process.  This beer is bitter by design and fairly light in body.  To allow the hop character to come through, we serve this beer on our nitrogen tap.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":3,"createDate":[2015,8,7,21,38,36],"updateDate":[2015,8,7,21,38,36],"style":{"id":3,"categoryId":1,"name":"Ordinary Bitter","shortName":"Bitter","description":"Ordinary bitter is gold to copper colored with medium bitterness, light to medium body, and low to medium residual malt sweetness. Hop flavor and aroma character may be evident at the brewer's discretion. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character and very low diacetyl (butterscotch) character are acceptable in aroma and flavor, but should be minimized in this form of bitter. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3","abvMax":"4.1","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"12","ogMin":"1.033","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,18,39],"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}}}
