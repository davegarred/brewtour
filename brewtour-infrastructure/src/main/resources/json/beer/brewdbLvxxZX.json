Malt character should be a balance of sweetness and toasted/nut-like malt; not caramel. Hop flavor should be low and hop aroma should be very low. Bocks can range in color from deep copper to dark brown. Fruity esters should be minimal. Diacetyl should be absent.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"30","abvMin":"6.3","abvMax":"7.5","srmMin":"20","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.066","fgMin":"1.018","fgMax":"1.024","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,38,54],"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":5,"name":"Spring","description":"Available during the spring months."},"glass":{"id":2,"name":"Goblet","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
