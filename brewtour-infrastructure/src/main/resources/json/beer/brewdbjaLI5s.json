The malty sweetness of a Weizenbock is balanced with a clove-like phenolic and fruity-estery banana element to produce a wellrounded aroma and flavor. As is true with all German wheat beers, hop bitterness is low and carbonation is high. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. It has a medium to full body. If dark, a mild roast malt character should emerge in flavor and to a lesser degree in the aroma. If this is served with yeast the beer may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"6.9","abvMax":"9.3","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.066","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,30,15],"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}}}
