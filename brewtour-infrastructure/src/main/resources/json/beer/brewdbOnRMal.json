{"breweryId":"nFgA09","id":"OnRMal","name":"Granny's Apple Ale","description":"This oginal beer was styled by our brewmaster Robert. He took inspiration from another, much sweeter apple ale he had come across and wanted to make one with his own influence and styled more to his personal liking. We start with a Kolsch style blonde recipe and add our own secret spices along with Washington apple cider at the end of the boil. We believe this beer could be the reason that BBQ Pizza was invented. We certainly recommend it.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":45,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,2,15,11,29,3],"updateDate":[2012,3,22,13,5,49],"style":{"id":45,"categoryId":4,"name":"German-Style Kölsch / Köln-Style Kölsch","shortName":"Kölsch","description":"Kölsch is warm fermented and aged at cold temperatures (German ale or alt-style beer). Kölsch is characterized by a golden to straw color and a slightly dry, subtly sweet softness on the palate, yet crisp. Good, dense head retention is desirable. Light pearapple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Caramel character should not be evident. The body is light to medium-light. This beer has low hop flavor and aroma with medium bitterness. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all. Chill haze should be absent.","ibuMin":"18","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.3","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"6","ogMin":"1.042","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,29,4],"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
