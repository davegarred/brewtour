The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-, nutmeg-like, mildly smoke-like or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters should be present at low to medium-high levels. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent or present at very low levels. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,29,27],"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":9,"name":"Weizen","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
