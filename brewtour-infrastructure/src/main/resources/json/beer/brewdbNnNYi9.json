{"breweryId":"NUZvIK","id":"NnNYi9","name":"Logger","description":"Very clean, crisp, and refreshing, this is a great beer for the newbie to the craft beer scene. The name Logger is a tribute to the logging community in the area. Contrary to the name itâ€™s not a lager, but our take on the Cream style ale. 2-row malted barley and flaked corn make up the grain bill, and German Hallertau are the hops.","abv":"5","ibu":"17","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":1,"styleId":109,"glasswareId":5,"srmId":7,"createDate":[2015,3,9,13,13,56],"updateDate":[2015,3,9,13,21,28],"style":{"id":109,"categoryId":11,"name":"American-Style Cream Ale or Lager","shortName":"Cream Ale","description":"Mild, pale, light-bodied ale, made using a warm fermentation (top or bottom) and cold lagering. Hop bitterness and flavor range from very low to low. Hop aroma is often absent. Sometimes referred to as cream ales, these beers are crisp and refreshing. Pale malt character predominates. Caramelized malt character should be absent. A fruity or estery aroma may be perceived. Diacetyl and chill haze should not be perceived. Sulfur character and/or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be extremely low or absent from this style of beer.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"22","abvMin":"4.2","abvMax":"5.6","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"5","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,42,30],"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]},"srm":{"id":7,"name":"7","hex":"F39C00"}}
