A light hop flavor and/or aroma is acceptable. Dubbels are also characterized by low-medium to medium bitterness. No diacetyl is acceptable. Yeastgenerated fruity esters (especially banana) are appropriate at low levels. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Often bottle conditioned a slight yeast haze and flavor may be evident.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"30","abvMin":"6.25","abvMax":"7.5","srmMin":"16","srmMax":"36","ogMin":"1.06","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,31,45],"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
