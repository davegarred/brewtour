{"breweryId":"YKa9wh","id":"cr6Qdl","name":"Pilsner","description":"Czech out Redhook’s newest brew.  Redhook Pilsner is crisp, golden lager that is modeled after those historic beers originally made in Plzeň, Czechoslovakia.  Redhook Pilsner’s maltiness is offset by a medium dose of Saaz hops and finishes with a clean, bright, thirst-quenching quality. A great “session” lager for when you’ve got a long day ahead of drinking.","abv":"5.3","ibu":"25","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":3,"styleId":76,"glasswareId":4,"createDate":[2012,3,20,1,49,12],"updateDate":[2015,12,16,15,20,6],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/cr6Qdl/upload_9SN5jr-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/cr6Qdl/upload_9SN5jr-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/cr6Qdl/upload_9SN5jr-large.png"},"style":{"id":76,"categoryId":7,"name":"Bohemian-Style Pilsener","shortName":"Bohemian Pilsener","description":"Traditional Bohemian Pilseners are medium bodied, and they can be as dark as a light amber color. This style balances moderate bitterness and noble-type hop aroma and flavor with a malty, slightly sweet, medium body. Extremely low levels of diacetyl and low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character, if perceived, are characteristic of this style and both may accent malt aroma. A toasted-, biscuit-like, bready malt character along with low levels of sulfur compounds may be evident. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"7","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,36,3],"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not available."},"glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
