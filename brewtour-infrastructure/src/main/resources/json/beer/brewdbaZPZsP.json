{"breweryId":"biGe6O","id":"aZPZsP","name":"Harvest Ale","description":"A beautiful red-orange beer with rich malty flavors that were \"harvested\" from an extra long boil in the kettle and balanced with the addition of Simcoe and Crystal hops.  This is a full bodied beer, which is perfect for our cool fall evenings in the Northwest.  This autumn seasonal has only a distant connection to the German \"Oktoberfest\" style from which it gets its inspiration.  Maltiness is the predominate flavor component of any true Oktoberfest style and also really stands out in our Harvest Ale.","abv":"5.6","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":7,"styleId":81,"glasswareId":5,"createDate":[2012,1,3,2,43,20],"updateDate":[2012,3,22,13,5,12],"style":{"id":81,"categoryId":7,"name":"German-Style Märzen","shortName":"Märzen","description":"Märzens are characterized by a medium body and broad range of color. They can range from golden to reddish orange. Sweet maltiness should dominate slightly over a clean hop bitterness. Malt character should be light-toasted rather than strongly caramel (though a low level of light caramel character is acceptable). Bread or biscuit-like malt character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Hop aroma and flavor should be low but notable. Ale-like fruity esters should not be perceived. Diacetyl and chill haze should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"18","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"5.3","abvMax":"5.9","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"15","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,36,50],"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":7,"name":"Fall","description":"Available during the fall months."},"glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":[2012,1,3,2,41,33]}}
