{"breweryId":"eRdXNO","id":"otlSAZ","name":"Easton Blonde","description":"Easton Blonde is a Belgian blonde, with Leffe blonde being the defining commercial example for the style.  Easton blonde has a slight sweetness to it, but is dominated by the peppery and phenolic notes that are typical of Belgian style yeasts.  These notes are complemented by the spicy hop aroma and flavor offered by noble hops. We added some sugar to the brew (which is standard) allowing for an increase in alcohol compared to our other beers, but retaining a dryness that allows for drink-ability.  The slight (at about 6% ABV) alcohol warming also increases the perception of the spicy, dry, phenolic character that defines the style.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":61,"glasswareId":6,"createDate":[2012,4,15,18,28,35],"updateDate":[2012,4,15,18,28,35],"style":{"id":61,"categoryId":5,"name":"Belgian-Style Blonde Ale","shortName":"Belgian Blonde","description":"Belgian-style blond ales are characterized by low yet evident hop bitterness, flavor, and sometimes aroma.
