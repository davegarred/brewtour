{"breweryId":"2BFwoJ","id":"DwCjWh","name":"Chuckanut & Hale's Collaboration Brew: Oak Barrel-Aged Smoked Dopplebock","description":"The design of this beer was intended to bring something from each brewery that the other has never done before! This is a smoked doppelbock to be aged in neutral oak barrels until the fall. A lager fermentation was carried out using Chuckanut Bavarian II yeast and barrel-aging from Hales. This beer will be dark brown to mahogany in color, with smoky/campfire notes and an aroma of caramel and brown sugar.\r\n\r\nThe malts used in this beer were Weyeremann Rauch (smoke) malt, Heildelberg pilsner, Weyeremann munich II, crystal 40, and pale chocolate. The beer was then hopped with Bravo, Czech Saaz and Tahoma. It's likely to finish at just over 8% ABV, and the maturation in barrels will continue to develop and polish the flavor of this beer. The body is expected to thin slightly, and the smoke aroma/flavor will develop into an umami meatiness, like the rounded flavor of top notch charcuterie. The barrels should contribute little-to-no flavor but will aid in the overall character of this beer. Expect this to be malt/yeast driven, having enough hop bitterness to balance any remaining malt sweetness. Overall, a very balanced, example of a traditional doppelbock made by two excellent breweries.","abv":"8","ibu":"45","isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","styleId":134,"createDate":[2015,6,12,16,13,29],"updateDate":[2015,6,12,16,13,29],"style":{"id":134,"categoryId":11,"name":"Wood- and Barrel-Aged Dark Beer","shortName":"BBL Aged Dark","description":"Any classic style or unique experimental style of dark beer can be wood or barrel-aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Dark fruited or spiced beer would also be appropriately entered in this category. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port/ whiskey/ wine/ sherry/ other), base beer style or achieved character. Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during judging.","abvMin":"3.75","abvMax":"6.5","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,46,44],"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}}}
