Dry stouts achieve a dry-roasted character through the use of roasted barley. The emphasis of coffee-like roasted barley and a moderate degree of roasted malt aromas define much of the character. Some slight acidity may be perceived but is not necessary. European hop aroma and flavor should be low or not perceived. Dry stouts have medium-light to medium body. Fruity esters are minimal and overshadowed by malt, high hop bitterness, and roasted barley character. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be very low or not perceived. Head retention and rich character should be part of its visual character.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,23,51],"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,45]}}}
