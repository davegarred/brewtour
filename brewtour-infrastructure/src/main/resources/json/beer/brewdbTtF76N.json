To appeal to both sides of her palate, we’ve blended our porter with a special one-off batch of pale ale for a unique limited edition release. And of course, we’ve named it after her. Or maybe just after a really great Elvis Costello tune.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":18,"createDate":[2015,3,6,21,21,3],"updateDate":[2015,3,6,21,21,3],"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.
