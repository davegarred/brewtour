{"breweryId":"2BFwoJ","id":"SZeLpZ","name":"Hale's & Diamond Knot Collaboration:  Abe Lincoln Lemon Ale","description":"Named for, well, Abe & Lincoln-- Diamond Knot & Hale's master brewers. Single-hopped with Lemondrop hops, Abe Lincoln Lemon Ale starts with hints of ginger zest and a big, fresh lemon aroma. Brewed to be open with an unobtrusive light body, it has plenty of space for its crisp fruity middle. Conditioned on twenty five pounds of lemon zest, your palate is left with a refreshingly dry, citrus finish that echoes of lemon rind and a sweet tartness that becomes more compelling with each sip. Honest in it's simplicity and low ABV, Abe Lincoln Lemon Ale is meant to deliver refreshment by the pint.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"12","isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":2,"styleId":119,"createDate":[2015,6,12,16,15,44],"updateDate":[2015,12,18,3,18,52],"labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/SZeLpZ/upload_MWgxIY-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/SZeLpZ/upload_MWgxIY-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/SZeLpZ/upload_MWgxIY-large.png"},"style":{"id":119,"categoryId":11,"name":"Fruit Beer","shortName":"Fruit Beer","description":"Fruit beers are any beers using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either, the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities. Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46],"updateDate":[2015,4,7,15,44,21],"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":[2012,3,21,20,6,46]}},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."}}
