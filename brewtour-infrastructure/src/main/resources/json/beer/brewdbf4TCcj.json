We named this beer after the infamous Beatles sycophant who promised to outfit Apple Studios with an over-the-top set of equipment that included a 72-track tape machine and a sonic force field to isolate Ringoâ€™s drums. We dedicate this over-the-top triple IPA to Magic Alex.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","availableId":3,"styleId":30,"createDate":[2015,3,6,21,38,50],"updateDate":[2015,3,6,21,38,50],"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
